Abstract: In Europe, near zero energy buildings (NZEBs) represent the new frontier of energy
efficiency in the built environment. Shifting the scale from NZEBs to net zero energy (NZE)
settlements represents the opportunity to achieve further energy, environmental, and cost benefits,
thanks to shared energy management, optimization of renewable energy systems, and microclimate
mitigation. In particular, the last aspect takes advantage of the implementation of local microclimate
mitigation strategies at a larger scale to improve settlements outdoor environmental conditions and
citizens’ wellbeing. Furthermore, this inter-building scale mitigation involves relatively less severe
working boundary conditions for buildings, able to both reduce building energy demand and improve
HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system’s efficiency. In this study, this potential
extra-energy saving, achievable without additional costs, is explored within the framework of a NZE
settlement built in Italy thanks to an ongoing Horizon 2020 project. Improved working conditions
for the operating air conditioning system and building energy savings thanks to settlement scale
opportunities for microclimate mitigation are assessed. Findings show how this effect represents a
further non-negligible energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable benefit achievable through
the design and construction of NZE settlements. Potential energy savings are up to 24% when
considering the double effect of microclimate mitigation.

1. Introduction
Urban heat island (UHI) is a well-acknowledged phenomenon strongly affecting cities’
thermal-energy performance and citizens’ wellbeing. It consists of higher temperatures in dense urban
environments with respect to the suburban and rural areas caused by anthropogenic heat, reduced
heat losses, and increased solar radiation absorption [1]. Therefore, the resulting positive thermal
balance of cities implies increased building cooling energy demand and consumption. On the other
hand, this phenomenon has a further negative impact on peak energy demand and buildings’ air
conditioning systems’ efficiency while considerably worsening building cooling performance [2]. As a
result, microclimate mitigation strategies have been studied to tackle the effect of climate change
related phenomena [3]. Among these technologies, those widely implemented are urban greenery,
cool materials [4], and water-based evaporative systems [5]. These strategies can demonstrably improve
the outdoor microclimate conditions in urban areas towards more livable cities and, consequently,
help reduce buildings’ cooling energy consumption [6].

Accordingly, these strategies should be taken into account when designing net zero energy (NZE)
settlements [7] and positive energy districts (PEDs) [8] and communities [9]. Compared to net/near
zero energy buildings (NZEBs), which are currently being worked towards with the goal of building
energy efficiency in Europe [10], the enlargement of the scale of NZE and PE districts empowers the
enhancement of energy efficiency and microclimate mitigation solutions’ implementation in common
areas and facilities, such as pavements, roofs, and gardens [11]. Therefore, on the one hand, energy
sharing and management can be optimized within the energy community due to improved flexibility.
On the other hand, the scale shift can take advantage of the implementation of green and high-reflectance
infrastructures in inter-building spaces [12]. A few studies highlighted the potential of district scale
design in terms of energy and environmental benefits. Ascione et al. [13] applied an integrated urban
planning design approach to a zero-energy settlement in Greece showing the significant energy and
sustainability improvement achievable for the NZEBs in this settlement. Kilkiş [14] evaluated the
performance of a new model for NZE districts in Sweden in terms of savings in per capita values.
Results demonstrated the achievable benefits, up to 6.1 MWh of exergy consumption and 4.2 tons of
CO2 emission savings. Focusing on a solar mixed-use community, Hachem-Vermette et al. [9] pointed
out that coupling thermal collectors with seasonal storage can lead from high-energy performance to
net positive energy districts. On the other hand, the role of outdoor microclimate mitigation strategies
in reducing the energy demand of buildings within a NZE settlement was shown in [15]. Mitigated
local boundary conditions could involve up to 10% cooling energy need reduction in an Italian case
study. Therefore, these strategies can be considered similar to the more traditional energy efficiency
solutions at early design stages for NZEBs in net zero and positive energy settlements.
As previously mentioned, the mitigation effect of local conditions associated with settlement
scale solutions is able to act on the efficiency of the buildings’ HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning) systems. The mitigation of boundary conditions involves less severe working conditions
for the HVAC systems, thus producing an extra contribution in terms of active energy efficiency
potential, such as, for instance, in the case of active cool roof effects [16]. In particular, air conditioning
unit efficiency significantly varies with varying inlet and outlet thermal working conditions [17].
Therefore, the dynamic behavior of different types of systems was highlighted in existing studies [18].
Chaiyat [19] analyzed the variation of air conditioning efficiency in the climate context of Thailand with
various configurations by using a thermal performance curve. Priarone et al. [20] used the curve fit
model to estimate the coefficient of performance (COP) and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a heat
pump installed in an NZEB in Italy for different temperature working conditions. They demonstrated
the suitability of this model to accurately represent the real system behavior. However, to the best of the
authors’ knowledge, the literature lacks analysis of the variation of air conditioning systems’ efficiency
curve due to the outdoor microclimate improvement associated with the previously mentioned
mitigation strategies at the settlement scale.
This work exploits building energy dynamic simulation to fill this gap through the evaluation of
NZEB energy demand reduction in summer and the further increase of the operational performance of
the HVAC system associated with the implementation of outdoor microclimate mitigation solutions
in a NZE settlement. The study is carried out within the framework of the ongoing Horizon 2020
ZERO-PLUS project, which has the goal of designing a market-ready, innovative, comprehensive,
and cost-effective system for NZE residential settlements in Europe [21] to demonstrate their
multidimensional sustainability. Building upon previous contributions [15,22], first, tailored weather
files that take into account the potential outdoor microclimate mitigation were generated to be used
as input boundary conditions in dynamic simulation. The files were developed considering the
evidence of other environmental mitigation studies [23]. Moreover, the mathematical model of the
direct expansion cooling coil of a heat pump was implemented to simulate the performance curve as a
function of air temperatures at the evaporator and the condenser side. Therefore, two scenarios were
investigated for the outdoor environmental boundary conditions: (i) a reference unmitigated scenario
and (ii) a mitigated scenario, which considers the impact of the implementation of microclimate

mitigation technologies in the inter-building area of the settlement, such as greenery, cool materials,
and water-based evaporative technologies. In addition, other two scenarios enlarging the area of
application of mitigation strategies at a district scale were assessed. Building energy performance
improvement was evaluated by combining the passive effect on the variation of the energy demand
and the active effect on the EER of the direct expansion cooling system, since they occur at the same
peak conditions.
2. Methods
The method presented in this work involved microclimate simulation and dynamic simulation of
a building’s thermal energy in sequence, as detailed in the following subsections. Weather analysis
and site-specific investigation was combined with microclimate computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
modelling. Such modelling output, therefore, represents the building’s settlement-specific boundary
conditions for the building-scale numerical assessment.
2.1. Weather Files and Influence of Microclimate Mitigation at Inter-Building Scale
The effect of implementing microclimate mitigation strategies, i.e., increase of (i) vegetated areas
and (ii) solar reflectance capability of built surfaces, on settlements’ outdoor environmental conditions at
the inter-building and district level was analyzed in previous works [15,24]. The improved microclimate
parameters were quantified through ENVI-met software (ENVI_MET GmbH, Essen, Germany) [25].
Therefore, starting from the hourly values obtained from these microclimate simulations, weather
data sets were generated using a tailored analytic code, and then the Meteonorm tool (Meteotest AG,
Bern, Switzerland) [26] was used as input with weather files for dynamic simulation of a building’s
thermal energy. In detail, ENVI-met simulation outputs in terms of direct and diffuse solar radiation,
dry-bulb air temperature, and wind speed for one day in winter and one day in summer were used.
The combination of the two mitigation strategies providing the maximum effect on the outdoor
microclimate conditions were considered. This procedure, used for the generation of the weather
files and presented in detail in [15,24], is based on the linear and sinusoidal interpolation of the ratio
between mitigated and reference unmitigated parameters on a daily and annual basis.
In this study, two of these weather files representing the reference unmitigated outdoor boundary
conditions and maximum potential mitigated outdoor boundary conditions were considered. Moreover,
the mitigated weather file was further improved to take into account the additional implementation of
water pond evaporative technologies. Thus, the three main existing microclimate mitigation strategies
are involved. The initial weather data set [15,24] was improved and double-checked through the
Elements tool of Big Ladder (Denver, Colorado) [27] by applying an average temperature reduction
of 2 K as inferred from the acknowledged study by Santamouris et al. [23]. The reference and the
mitigated weather files were used as input outdoor environmental conditions for the thermal-energy
performance assessment of a case study residential NZEB.
2.2. Building Modeling
The building type selected as case study for this analysis is a single-family detached house.
A simplified standard building was theoretically modeled for the location of Granarolo dell‘Emilia,
Bologna, Italy, where the pilot Italian settlement of the ZERO-PLUS project [21] is actually located.
The building has a two-story rectangular shape with an attic, a sloped roof, and a gross conditioned
area of about 200 m2 , in order to be representative of new Italian single-family house constructions.
According to the purpose of this work, the building was modeled within a NZE settlement through
the EnergyPlus simulation engine [28]. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the current Italian
regulation for new NZEBs [29] in terms of thermal-energy performance. Since the regulation also
includes requirements for the HVAC system in its definition of NZEB, an iterative procedure was carried
out to meet these primary energy consumption requirements for the model. This procedure started
from the reference building and its envelope thermal properties to set the characteristics the HVAC

both the external weather conditions considered for the calculation, i.e., the reference and the mitigated
scenarios, and according to the design conditions for the supply air into the thermal zone. After

As of the air conditioning system’s numerical modeling, the generalized least squares method
was used for curve fitting to represent the direct expansion cooling coil. Performance curves were
developed based on the data declared by the manufacturer. According to [34], the model is a black-box
model, since it does not represent the physical behavior of the system components. Starting from
the manufacturer’s performance data, the performance curves were obtained by varying the indoor
wet-bulb air temperature at the evaporator and the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature at the condenser.
Some of the performance data from the manufacturer of the heat pump considered in this study are
summarized in Table 1. In particular, the total cooling capacity and the energy input ratio (EIR) are
representative of the performance of the system. Therefore, the total cooling capacity and the EIR
modifier curves, which are functions of temperature, were developed [35]. These quadratic curves
depend on two independent variables: the dry-bulb temperature of inlet air in the air-cooled condenser
coil and the wet-bulb temperature of the inlet air in the cooling coil. Accordingly, when varying the
outdoor boundary conditions of operation (weather file), the inlet air dry-bulb temperature in the
condenser varies along with the system performance. The modified curves’ output was then multiplied
by the rated total cooling capacity and the rated EIR [36] to provide the total cooling capacity and the
EIR, respectively, at the specific inlet air temperatures for the operation of the DX cooling coil unit.

where X and Y are the two independent variables (temperatures), and ai are the coefficients of the
curves to be determined based on the specific system operation. The parameters of Ccool,tot and the
EIR modifier curves are reported in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. First, the generated curves were
validated against the rated values to verify that the curve value at the rated condition established
by AHRI [36] was 1.0. Therefore, the goodness of the curves was evaluated by the calculation of the
statistical parameter R2 . This parameter provides the ratio between the sum of the squared deviations
of the values of the curve fit from the mean and the sum of the squared deviations of the values of
the manufacturer’s data from the mean. The closer the R2 values are to 1, the better the curve fit.
The values of R2 obtained for the two curves are reported in Tables 2 and 3.

perspective: building energy demand reduction due to less severe outdoor boundary conditions
(passive benefits) and air conditioning system operational efficiency increase given microclimate
mitigation affecting working conditions (active benefits). The study was carried out considering a
residential NZEB part of a NZE settlement, according to the ZERO-PLUS project concept, as a case
study. Results show that the implementation of microclimate mitigation strategies in the outdoor
areas of the settlement provides a non-negligible beneficial effect not only in terms of less severe
environmental conditions but also in terms of the efficiency of the operation of the direct expansion
cooling system. In particular, the effect of the combination of three mitigation techniques, i.e., cool,
green, and water-based infrastructures, quantitatively accounted for in a mitigated weather file inputted
into a dynamic simulation of a building, achieved building cooling energy reduction up to 18.7%
thanks to the combination of improved EER of the air conditioning system and reduced cooling
demand. Moreover, when shifting from the inter-building to the settlement scale of application of the
mitigation strategies, the total passive cooling saving was increased up to 24% in the scenario with four
rings of residential buildings around the case study building compared to the reference. Specifically,
the EER itself may have potentially increased up to 21% in the largest settlement configuration
(mitigated_5rings scenario). Therefore, this study highlights the potential passive and active benefits of
outdoor microclimate mitigation in terms of building thermal-energy performance achievable thanks
to shift of the scale of analysis to the settlement level. The final findings may be of use for policy
makers and energy experts in order to better size optimal settlement configurations towards the energy
communities of prosumers being developed all around Europe.
