Abstract: There are international activities and on-going initiatives, particularly at the European
level, to define what Positive Energy Districts should be, as the driving concept for the urban
transition to a sustainable future. The first objective of the paper is to contribute to the on-going and
lively debate about the definition of the notion of Sustainable Plus Energy Neighbourhood (SPEN),
which highlights the multiple dimensions when talking about sustainability in districts moving
beyond the traditional and strict building energy assessment. Based on a holistic methodology
which ensures the consideration of the multidimensional nature and goals of SPEN, the paper
outlines an evaluation framework. The evaluation framework defines the key performance indicators
distributed in five categories that consider energy and power performance, GHG emissions, indoor
environmental quality, smartness, flexibility, life cycle costs and social sustainability. This framework
is designed to be implemented during integrated design processes aiming to select design options
for a neighbourhood as well within during the operational phase for monitoring its performance.
Further work will include the implementation and validation of the framework in four real-life
positive energy neighbourhoods in different climate zones of Europe as part of syn.ikia H2020 project.

Over the course of syn.ikia H2020 project [1], four real-life Sustainable Plus Energy
Neighbourhoods (SPEN) tailored to four different climatic zones will be developed, analysed, optimised and monitored, demonstrating the functionality of the plus-energy neighbourhood concept in Europe. When it comes to the implementation of sustainable development in the construction sector, the focus has started shifting from individual buildings
(micro-scale) to districts and cities (meso- and macro-scale) (Figure 1). The idea of shifting scales is based on believing that the sustainability challenge has to do with more

knowledge sharing among more than 190 cities in 38 counties in Europe. The International
Energy Agency EBC Annex 83 [11] started to work on developing an in-depth definition of

related to positive energy districts. Finally, the COST Action CA19126 “Positive Energy
Districts European Network” [12] will establish a PED innovation eco-system to facilitate
open sharing of knowledge and support the capacity building of new generation PED
professionals, early Career Investigators as well as experienced practitioners. Outside
Europe, NREL developed a guide to show how the implementation of district-scale highperformance scalable strategies can be suitable approaches to achieve deep energy savings,
to increase affordability, reduce emissions and improve resilience [13].
Despite the above-mentioned efforts, there is still no standard definition of the PED
concept, even if a shared definition developed by the EERA JPSC together with the JPI
Urban Europe, integrates a wide vision of different projects and programs in Europe. It
gathers the main characteristics of the PED projects and precursors of PEDs [14]. According
to this work, up to four categories of PEDs have been established based on two main
aspects: the boundaries and limits of the PED in order to reach a net positive yearly
energy balance and the energy exchanges (import/export) in order to compensate for
energy surpluses and shortages between the buildings and the external grid [15]. The four
categories are:
1.

2.

3.

4.

Auto-PED (PED autonomous): “plus-autarkic”, net positive yearly energy balance
within the geographical boundaries of the PED and internal energy balance at any
moment in time (no imports from the hinterland) or even helping to balance the wider
grid outside;
Dynamic-PED (PED dynamic): net positive yearly energy balance within the geographical boundaries of the PED but dynamic exchanges through the boundary
compensate for momentary surpluses and shortages;
Virtual-PED (PED virtual): net positive yearly energy balance within virtual boundaries of the PED and also dynamic exchanges with outside to compensate surpluses
and shortages; and
Candidate-PED (pre-PED): no net positive yearly energy balance within the geographical boundaries of the PED but energy difference is provided by the market with
certified green energy.

All of the described categories of PEDs are based on the accomplishment of a yearly
positive energy balance, measured in greenhouse gas emissions, with use of renewables
within the defined boundaries. Auto-and Dynamic-PEDs are the only categories where
a net positive energy balance is achieved and Candidate-PED should compensate the
energy difference with imported certified energy from outside the boundary. The difference
between Auto-PED and Dynamic-PED is that the first does not need to import energy at
any time. The difference between Dynamic-PED and Virtual-PED is that the latter defines
the boundaries of the PED as virtual and they are not limited to a geographical area.
The ISO 52000-1:2017 is the overarching EPB (Energy Performance of Buildings)
standard, providing the general framework of the EPB assessment based on primary
energy as the main indicator. In order to evaluate the Positive Energy Balance, the set of
EPB standards play a key role to assess the energy performance as defined in the recast
of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) (The EPBD and the EED have
been amended by Directive (EU) 2018/844, which entered into force on 9 July 2018). Each
of the five EPB standards describes an important step in the assessment of the energy
performance of single buildings and a building portfolio [16] From the amended (2018)
text of EPBD Annex 1, point 1: “Member States shall describe their national calculation
methodology following the national annexes of the overarching standards, namely ISO
52000-1, 52003-1, 52010-1, 52016-1, and 52018-1, developed under mandate M/480 given to
the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)”. When the positive energy balance
assessment moves from a single building to a group of buildings (Building Portfolio) at the
neighbourhood scale, new considerations are needed in terms of integrating urban and
energy planning to evaluate the overall energy performance. Furthermore, neighbourhoods
include other technological, spatial, regulatory, financial, legal, environmental, social and
economic perspectives, but also barriers and challenges, which are not fully covered nor

planned by the EPBD and EPB standards. Among them, barriers for changing household
behavioural need to be understood and analysed to design measures that make households
to contribute in mitigating climate change [17].
Moving from the building to the neighbourhood scale fits very well with the smartness
imperative of exploiting all of the potential from collaborative approaches. The SPEN
concept includes a profound integration and interoperability between buildings, urban
spaces [18], the grid and infrastructures, but also with their governance. For instance,
when focusing on a set of buildings, it is required to consider a common technical system
whose energy performance considers the aggregated performance. Aggregation articulates
synergies and discloses higher potential for smart and mutual interaction [19]. Therefore,
the neighbourhood scale will foster sustainability through economies of scale, aggregation
synergies (e.g., the deployment of flexibility and integration) and a considerable involvement of stakeholders and communities. The vision of future buildings described in [20]
sees buildings as active components of larger districts which should be able to adapt
to changing environmental conditions and occupancy, supporting well-being and using
resources efficiently. The authors of [20] proposed a framework with 14 metrics to drive the
transformation of the building stock with 100-year targets. The authors of [21] stresses the
need for clear, comprehensible and structured definitions, including KPIs, after reviewing
144 scientific publications and analysed 35 terminologies on zero emission neighbourhoods,
positive energy districts and similar concepts of climate friendly neighbourhoods.
The objective of this paper is to present and define the concept of Sustainable Plus Energy Neighbourhood (SPEN) which highlights the need of considering mutual interaction
between the built environment, the inhabitants and the nature (Figure 2). The definition
aims to contribute to the on-going debate for a common vision of what a PED should
consider. Through a multidimensional analysis to address complexity in neighbourhoods,
this paper outlines an assessment framework for the performance evaluation of SPEN. The
selection of the main assessed categories and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been
based on a holistic and comprehensive methodology which highlights the multiple dimensions of sustainability in the built environment. The contents of the paper are based on
the work developed in the syn.ikia project [22] with extended details on the methodology
applied, revised definitions and concise and synthetic presentation of the metrics. Section 2
presents the definition of the SPEN and Section 3 describes the methodology applied to
select the different categories and indicators ensuring multidimensionality. The core key
performance
indicators are presented for each dimension in the results

A SPEN couples the built environment with sustainable energy generation, use, and
mobility (e.g., EV charging) to create added value for the citizens;
A SPEN optimally use advanced technologies and materials, local RES, and other
solutions as local storage, smart energy management systems, demand-response, user
interaction ICT, etc.; and
A SPEN offers affordable housing, high-quality indoor environment, and well-being
for the human beings.
SPEN should be focused in five areas named the 5D areas:

•
•
•
•
•

Decentralisation: neighbourhoods, as flexibility providers, allow higher penetration
of renewable energy sources into the grid and increase flexibility;
Democracy: empowered and conscious users having access to affordable homes and
high-quality neighbourhoods;
Decarbonisation: climate neutral, meaning efficient districts with a minimal final
energy consumption and generating a surplus of energy from renewable sources;
Digitalisation: ICT based neighbourhoods integrating smart networks that provide
well-managed built environment for the citizens; and
Design: highly attractive energy-efficient urban neighbourhoods by means of an
integrated energy, architectural and outdoor spaces design that increase their market
uptake.
5S strategies are identified as the ones that facilitate the achievement of SPENs:

•
•

•
•

•

Save: reducing the neighbourhood net energy consumption by using solutions based
on a total life cycle cost analysis;
Shave: facilitating peak shaving through load shifting, control, and storage, thus
reducing the size of energy supply installations, increasing self-consumption of renewable energy, and reducing the stress on the grid;
Share: sharing of resources such as energy, infrastructure, and common spaces with
neighbours;
Shine: ensuring high quality architecture, creating good indoor and outdoor environments and solutions that make the occupants and the community proud of their
neighbourhood;
Scale: benefitting from large-scale effects of the neighbourhood scale to replicate
the solutions.

2.2. SPEN and Different Level of System Boundaries
There is a continuous discussion of where to define the system boundaries, i.e., what
energy elements to include in the balance when developing and defining PEDs. From a
technical point of view, a SPEN is characterised by achieving a positive energy balance
within a given system of boundaries according to an Energy Community scheme [24].
There are multiple ways to cover the RES generation in a SPEN. Moving from the single
building boundary to the neighbourhood scale widens the on-site generation possibilities significantly. The scale is not restricted to on-site boundaries and, when using the
SPEN smartness attributes, a SPEN may expand beyond the physical boundaries of the
community. The SPEN boundary may address two different levels:

•

Functional Boundary: On one hand, a functional boundary addresses the spatialphysical limits of the building portfolio and the neighbourhood. On the other hand, it
addresses the limits with regards to the energy grids considering them as a functional
entity of the neighbourhood that they serve. (e.g., a district heating system that can be
considered as a functional part of the neighbourhood even if its service area is substantially larger than the heating sector of the building portfolio in question). Renewable
share of the energy infrastructures (e.g., electricity from the grid) is included in the
balance with the use of appropriate conversion factors from final energy to primary
energy or CO2 emissions.

Energies 2021, 14, 4314

7 of 25

•

Virtual Boundary: This addresses the limits in contractual terms, e.g., including a
renewable energy generation system owned by the occupants but situated outside
the geographical boundaries (e.g., an offshore wind turbine owned through shares by
the community).

According to these boundaries descriptions, and aligned to the draft definition of
PEDs from the EERA JPSC working group and JP Urban Europe [15], the net positive yearly
energy balance of a SPEN will be assessed within the functional or virtual boundaries.
Thus, a SPEN will achieve a positive yearly energy balance having dynamic exchanges
within the functional/virtual boundaries, but in addition, it will provide a connection
between buildings inside the boundaries of the neighbourhood. In a SPEN, buildings can
be digitally connected by means of a digital cloud hub (HUB), sharing ICT infrastructure
and energy management systems.
3. Methodology: Ensuring Multidimensionality in Selection of Indicators
Assessment of SPENs can be a challenging exercise, since neighbourhoods, energy
systems on a neighbourhood scale and sustainability itself are complex to evaluate [25,26].
Thus, evaluation frameworks that are already present agree on the fact that neighbourhoods
can only be evaluated when taking the combined effect of multiple factors into account.
From a completely different point of view, it is really important for different legislative measures and interventions to consider the actual problems, and react to the existing practice.
Otherwise it is possible, that their effectiveness will be limited. Consequently, a holistic approach need to be used to ensure the consideration of appropriate measures and mitigation
of known obstacles [27]. Decision-making processes consists of numerous independent
factors differing by stakeholders and other levels, i.e., political interests, personal beliefs,
market orientation, etc. [28]. In a proper decision making process, all of these drivers need
to be considered. Therefore, it is needed to design a holistic, multidimensional assessment
framework considering all elements of a SPEN that can diagnose and adapt to numerous
district resources, cater for different users and market conditions and initiate commercial
arrangements between partners in and out of the SPEN. Creating connected and equitable
targets across multiple dimensions is also described as the “ energy trilemma” by the World
Energy Council (WEC). It is described as a combination of three equally important factors:
environmental sustainability, energy security and energy equity. Valdes [25] mentioned
that it is critical to review the robustness of the indicators. Ensuring multidimensionality
on the selection level can be done with the help of four design consideration: avoidance
of selection bias (Diversity analysis); avoidance of anchoring bias (Multiple valid impact
chains) [26]; avoidance of overreliance on available and measurable data (Multiple valid
impact chains) [28]; and avoidance of multicollinearity (D-separation) [29,30].
To make sure, that all the previously described considerations are ensured, directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) are built, and the KPIs are tagged along different aspects. Through
a diversity analysis, tagged KPIs are able to ensure the heterogeneity and avoidance of
selection bias, while with the help of a method called “d-separation” and by creating at
least two impact chains for each goal, DAGs can ensure the rest of the design considerations.
Tagging key performance indicators (KPIs) is a widely used approach and it is able to
help ensuring the heterogeneity and spread of KPIs across different aspects. Usually,
sustainability focused indicator development frameworks are based on the ‘three pillars
of sustainability’: environmental, social and economic pillars [31]. Furthermore, there
are other aspects when we consider the intersections of the previously mentioned pillars:
livable, equitable and the viable dimensions as presented in Figure 4.

where pi is the proportion of indicators belonging to the i-th tag structure for the indicator
set in question. DAGs are created to map the different indicators related to the drivers
present for each performance to be measured in SPEN. Expert knowledge was used to
define cause and effect relations between indicators of different drivers.
4. Results
As result of the application of the methodology described in Section 3, five KPI
categories were identified and are defined as shown below:

•

Energy and Environmental, which address overall energy and environmental performance, matching factors between load and on-site renewable generation and grid
interaction;
Economic, addressing capital costs and operational costs;
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), addressing thermal and visual comfort, as well
as indoor air quality;
Social, which addresses the aspects of equity, community and human outcomes; and
Smartness and Flexibility, addressing the ability to be smartly managed.

Table 1 summarizes the 38 core indicators selected for the SPEN evaluation framework
organised per category and sub-category. Details of each key indicators are described in
the following sub-sections.

The individual indicator sets have the following diversity indices in Table 2. The most
evenly distributed diverse KPI variation can have a Shannon index of 2.30, which is the
maximum value we can get from each indicator set. Considering the fact that every tag is
represented at least once, and using a threshold value of 2.00 by Shannon indices, it can be
stated that each indicator set is sufficiently diverse.

Causal DAG is created for all of the project goals. For the sake of simplification, these
goals are presented by their DAG handles shown in Table 3. An overview of the DAG
shows that for every main goal, there are at least two different impact chains, or in other
words, there are at least two arrows pointing towards the goal from the outer circle in
Figure 5. The five main goals are presented in the inside of the circle. The size of the nodes
represents the number of arrows pointing to the node. The more inbound arrows are,
the bigger the nodes. Edge colours are inherited from the target nodes at the end of each
causal chain. Since for every goal there are multiple ways and multiple considerations
considered, it is ensured that the risk of anchoring biases and the overreliance of available
data is mitigated.

performance of each neighbourhood and their interaction with the connected energy networks follows the methodology of the Energy Performance of new and existing Buildings
(EPB) described in the ISO-52000 standards [33] based on primary energy balance. In general terms, the overall energy performance of a building, by measurement or calculation,
should be based on hourly or sub-hourly values of the different energy carrier flows in the
buildings and by the exchanged energy (delivered and exported energy) with the energy
networks in their broad concept (electricity, thermal energy with district heating and cooling networks, natural gas, biomass, etc.). Sub-categories for the energy and environmental

4.1.2. Matching Factors
Load match factors describe the degree of the utilization of on-site energy generation
related to the energy use in the neighbourhood. These factors characterize the direct use
of energy generated inside the assessment boundary over a period and time (e.g., a day,
a month or a year). Their calculation should be done on sub-hourly or hourly basis to
characterize correctly the simultaneous use of on-site produced energy and the energy
exchanged with the grid [2,35]. In the literature, the same concept has received different

4.1.2. Matching Factors
Load match factors describe the degree of the utilization of on-site energy generation
related to the energy use in the neighbourhood. These factors characterize the direct use
of energy generated inside the assessment boundary over a period and time (e.g., a day,
a month or a year). Their calculation should be done on sub-hourly or hourly basis to
characterize correctly the simultaneous use of on-site produced energy and the energy
exchanged with the grid [2,35]. In the literature, the same concept has received different
names. Two complementary indexes have been used: the load cover factor [2] or selfgeneration [36] and the supply cover factor [2,34] or self-consumption [36]. This can also
be complemented with a third indicator:grid delivered factor or grid purchase ratio [37].
In case the energy use represents the useful energy demand, the grid purchase factor is a
more reliable indicator and allows a fairer comparison of different systems, particularly if
local electric and thermal storage are charged with renewables and/or the efficiencies of
the compared systems differs.

•

•

•

Load Cover Factor/Self-Generation: The load cover factor is the relation between
the energy produced on-site and directly used and the total electric energy use. In
ISO-52000, this factor is named use matching fraction.
Supply Cover Factor/Self-Consumption: The supply cover factor is the relation between the energy produced on-site and directly used and the total on-site produced
energy. In ISO-52000, this factor is named the production matching fraction.
Grid Delivered Factor: The grid delivered factor is the relation between the energy
delivered from the grid and the total energy used by the system over a time period. It
characterizes the dependency of the neighbourhood of the grid [37].

4.1.3. Grid Interaction Factors
Grid interaction indicators are based on the net energy which represents the electricity
interaction between the neighbourhood and the grid, per energy carrier. For a proper
analysis of grid interaction, sub hourly resolution data is required (recommended in the
range of 1–5 min and 15 min as a maximum) as there is a relatively high impact due to time
averaging effects [38].

•

•

•

Net Energy/Net Power: Net energy allows one to assess the interaction of a system
with the energy grids over a certain period: a day, a month or a year. In doing that,
it is useful to represent the net energy using a duration curve, colored carpet plots
and/or box plots [2]. This kind of visual representations allows for an immediate
comprehension of the distribution of power and the differences between alternative
solutions. Figure 7 shows schematically the net energy duration curve. It should be
noted that the red area of the net load duration curve represents the net delivered
energy. In the case of a yearly duration curve, the red area of the duration curve is
equal to annual delivered energy, while the green area is equal to annual exported
energy. In coherence with the definition of SPEN and the ISO52000 set of standards,
we refer to net energy exchange as a result of an energy balance considering onsite/nearby generated energy to cover the EPD energy use. If parts of the energy
uses of the building and neighbourhood are discarded in the energy assessment,
actual metered grid interaction will differ from the calculated one, as represented
schematically in Figure 7.
Peak Delivered/Peak Exported Power: The peak delivered and peak exported power
KPIs are the extreme values of the net duration curve. The maximum positive value is
the peak delivered, while the maximum negative value is the peak exported.
Connection Capacity Credit: The connection capacity credit, or power reduction
potential [39], is defined as the percentage of grid connection capacity that could be
saved compared to a reference case [40,41].

4.2.1. Capital Costs
Capital costs in the SPEN evaluation framework refer to complete building construction cost and the cost of assets or items that are purchased or implemented with the aim
of improving the energy efficient aspects of the system [41]. As stated earlier, such assets
or items can include but are not limited to multi-functional façade elements with integrating photovoltaic and solar thermal, heat pumps, thermal storages and batteries.

4.2.1. Capital Costs
Capital costs in the SPEN evaluation framework refer to complete building construction cost and the cost of assets or items that are purchased or implemented with the aim of
improving the energy efficient aspects of the system [41]. As stated earlier, such assets or
items can include but are not limited to multi-functional façade elements with integrating
photovoltaic and solar thermal, heat pumps, thermal storages and batteries.

•

•

Investment Costs (€/m2 ): This indicator calculates the costs of the newly built or
refurbished building, assets or items and is defined as cumulated payments until the
initial operation of the system.
Share of Investments Covered by Grants (€/m2 ): This indicator considers any grants
or subsidies that should be accounted as capital costs in order to reflect a truly marketbased approach in evaluating the cost efficiency of SPENs.

4.2.2. Operational Costs
In the operation and maintenance of SPENS, respective operational costs are incurred,
from maintenance to repairs and replacements over a period of time. These costs can vary
for each year [41].

•

•
•
•

Maintenance-Related Costs (€/m2 /year): This indicator encompasses depreciation,
interests, repairs and replacements of those assets or items purchased or implemented
to improve the energy efficiency aspects of the system.
Requirement-Related Costs (€/m2 /year): This indicator is defined as power and fuel
costs, costs for operating resources and in some cases external costs.
Operation-Related Costs (€/m2 /year): This indicator relates to the costs of using the
installation.
Other Costs (€/m2 /year): This indicator captures other costs such as the cost of
insurance.

4.2.3. Overall Economic Performance
This sub-category of overall economic performance represents important factors in
the decision-making in real estate markets (new built and renovation) from the perspective
of building owners and investors. They provide an evaluation of the relative benefits of a
particular choice of investment. They summarize both the capital costs and the operational
costs together with possible sources of income in a single indicator. Within this sub-category
of KPIs, the Net Present Value is the one that is considered the most reliable [43]. In some
cases, especially when liquidity is a limiting factor, other KPIs, such as the Payback Period,
might be more relevant to the building owner or investor.

•

•
•

•
•

Net Present Value (€): The Net Present Value (NPV) is computed as the difference
between the investment and the discounted cash flows related to an investment. In the
context of SPENs, the cash flows can be represented by the yearly savings obtained
by entering the project. These savings can be discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of
return to provide an estimate of the value of these savings as if the investors would
obtain them at the same moment when the investment occurs. The discount rate needs
to be defined using available ones employed in similar projects or recovered from the
stock market.
Internal Rate of Return: The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is defined as the discount
rate that makes the current value of savings equal to the initial investment.
Economic Value Added (€):The Economic Value Added is a quick evaluation measure
that can be computed as the difference between the yearly savings and the minimum
required savings.
Payback Period (year): The Payback Period is the number of years it takes before the
cumulative savings equals the initial investment.
nZEB Cost Comparison (%): The nZEB Cost Comparison is computed as the ratio
between the total cost of the respective investment and its nZEB alternative. The

Energies 2021, 14, 4314

calculation period should cover the expected lifetime of the SPEN and the reference,
e.g., 50 years.
4.3. Indoor Environmental Quality
People spend approximately 90% of their time in indoor environments [44]. Over the
last decades, an abundant number of studies have shown that the indoor environmental
quality (IEQ) has a significant impact on human health and wellbeing [45]. IEQ refers to
the quality of a building’s environment with respect to wellbeing and health of the building
occupants and is determined by many factors such as indoor thermal environment, air
quality and lighting and acoustics [46]. Well designed and implemented plus energy

buildings and neighbourhoods can bring multiple benefits, including improvements

the thermal environment. The calculation formulas for the PMV and PPD indexes are in

comfort is often expressed in percentage of the number of people who are satisfied or dissatisfied with the thermal conditions. The most commonly used indexes are the predicted
mean vote (PMV) and the predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD)—these will be KPIs of
the thermal environment. The calculation formulas for the PMV and PPD indexes are in line
with the ISO 7730 and ASHRAE Standard 55. Air temperature (◦ C) and relative humidity
(%) will be additional KPIs of the thermal environment of buildings without mechanical
cooling. To evaluate the thermal environment, the percentage of time that temperatures are
out of the ranges specified in the categories of EN 16798, should be estimated for buildings
with and without cooling systems for the heating and cooling seasons.
4.3.3. Lighting and Visual Comfort
According to the EN12665, visual comfort is defined as “a subjective condition of
visual well-being induced by the visual environment”. A good visual environment (e.g.,
adequate levels of natural and artificial lighting, reduced glare, etc.) can add to the wellbeing and productivity of the building occupants [57]. Illuminance is the total amount of
light delivered on a surface by either natural daylight or electrical fitting. In this project, the
illuminance (lux) and the daylight factor (%) will be measured and simulated to evaluate
the visual environment and will serve as the KPIs of the lighting and visual comfort.
Daylight factor is a metric expressing, as a percentage, the amount of daylight that is
available in a room in comparison to the amount of daylight available outside under
overcast sky conditions [57]. The daylight factor depends on the size, the transmission
properties of the façade, the size and shape of the space as well as the extent to which
external structures obscure the view of the sky.
4.3.4. Acoustic Comfort
Acoustic comfort includes the protection of building occupants from noise in order to
provide a suitable acoustic environment for the designed human activity [58]. Depending
on the levels of noise, it can cause annoyance, hearing damage or interference to speech
intelligibility [59]. The acoustic environment should be designed to avoid these harmful
effects and the criteria used to ask for an acceptable c environment are expressed in sound
levels decibels (dB), noise rating (NR) or noise criteria (NC). To determine the quality levels
of acoustic comfort in the living room, the percentage of hours that the level of acoustics
exceed noise levels defined in the categories specified in EN 16798 will be estimated. The
sound pressure level (dB(A)) will serve as the KPI of the acoustic comfort.
4.4. Social Performance
There are no standards on how to monitor social sustainability, which is due to
inconsistencies in its definition [60]. Defining what social includes and what it does not
is bound to political and contextual factors [61]. Social performance in the SPEN context
is defined as the fidelity of development with human and societal values. This evolution
should foster an environment that achieves reconciling cohabitation and heterogeneity,
fostering cohesive community practices and improving in quality of life for. To achieve
this, social performance is assessed on three pillars simultaneously (see Figure 10).

•
•
•

Equity: assessment of the fair, just and legitimate functioning of the community.
Community: assessment of the ability of the community to maintain itself and thrive.
People: assessment of human experiences, behaviour and outcomes.

Some methodological adjustments are necessary when evaluating social performance [62].
First, social KPIs vary most across different scales: on national levels demographic, systemic variables are prevalent, while on hyperlocal levels focus more on social interactions
and quality of life. The neighbourhood scale is a mix of both, since it is place-based, but
also requires some form of institutionalization in the PED context [63]. Second, it is not
always apparent, whether a specific result for an indicator is good or bad, plus, in many
cases this is location-dependent, meaning universal benchmarks are rarely feasible [60,64].
Third, social performance should be measured both as an objective variable and as the

(here, energy assets) are shared. It includes just, equitable, accountable distribution of
influence, blind to all aspects of identity or personal resources. Core KPIs are:

•

•

•

•

Access to Services measures whether services of general interest (education, groceries,
healthcare, green, etc. as discussed in EC Com (2011) 900) are in walkable distance
to all households. It is a GIS-based assessment through the aggregation of distances
evaluated against service-specific thresholds for each service and each household.
This metric indicates both walkability—for an environmental perspective [67]—and
spatial justice—for a social perspective [68].
Affordability of Energy is the adoption the standardised European “arrears” and
“share of income spent on energy” indicators for energy poverty developed by the European Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV) [69]. It is measured through a household
survey and reflects the wider goal of providing just sustainable transition for all [70].
Affordability of Housing is measuring, in a household survey the share of people
with a housing cost overburden, and mapping the income required to afford housing
in the SPEN. This is partially in line with the European standard of relating housing
costs to income [71–73], but considers more items on the cost side to fully reflect real
cost of housing—notably mortgage principals. Also, the second metric of the KPI
indicates whether the SPEN is gated or affordable for the larger population.
Democratic Legitimacy is measured by two sets of criteria: objective and subjective.
Objective criteria are measured on the process and content of stakeholder consultation [74], while the subjective part is a survey of participants on their experiences of
the process [72]. Legitimacy is critical to ensure the principle of subsidiarity [75], and
a fair consideration of individual interests in collective and top-down decisions [36].

Energies 2021, 14, 4314

•

Living Conditions are the adoption of overcrowding and common poor living condition “red flags” monitored by Eurostat, which in turn refers to SDGs 1, 6 and
11 [67,73]. These are measured in household surveys as they are determinants of
social, health-related and environmental outcomes [67,69,71,73].

In addition to the core KPIs presented here, complementary KPIs that may be included
in this category are access to amenities [68], sustainable mobility and accessibility to
universal design [76].
4.4.2. Community
Community indicators describe the resilience, and self-reinforcing quality of local
communities. On the one hand, this refers to maintenance of social networks, including
absorbing newcomers and engaging with existing members. On the other hand, this refers
to social capital exchange in social networks, including the use of public spaces and other
channels for meaningful interactions, conflict resolution, and supporting one another.

•

Social Cohesion addresses the existence and the conditions for strong social networks, formed on trust-based bonds, with a capacity to absorb and build on diversity [72,77,78]. The indicator has a subjective, normative component that evaluates
personal resilience attributed to belonging in a household survey [72,78]. It also has
descriptive component, in a form of a checklist of environmental features that can
support social cohesion [71,79].

4.4.3. People
People indicators refer to social performance measured on individuals and describing
personal, human conditions. These cover human needs, like health, employment, education, security, and quality of life metrics, such as wellbeing, happiness and comfort.
Additionally, people indicators include environmental determinants for both of the above.
Lastly, they describe how sustainably people inhabit their SPEN, how they behave and
interact with their environment, and its resources.

•

•

Personal Safety refers to the goal of providing safe, non-intrusive public and shared
spaces eliminating deterrents of walking and staying outdoors, especially for women [68].
The indicator has a subjective, normative component that is the adoption of standard
Eurostat metrics in a household survey [73]. It also has a descriptive component, in a
form of a checklist of environmental features that are associated with perceived and
real safety in public space.
Energy Consciousness describes the behavioural determinants of energy use, which
is crucial to eliminate occupant-centric barriers to coordinated, environmentally conscious energy management [63]. The indicator is measured through a household
survey. The survey extracts personal drivers behind environmental, energy, and
technology-related decisions based on common behavioral models [80,81]. These
helps classify the main drivers per social group and guidelines are provided how to
respond to specific driver classes.

4.5. Smartness and Flexibility
Smartness and flexibility refers to the ability of the built environment to manage its
energy demand and local generation according to the climate conditions, user needs and
preferences and grid requirements. For its assessment, two sub-categories are defined:
flexibility and smartness (see Figure 11). The Flexibility Index and the Smart Readiness
Indicator (SRI) are proposed as KPIs, respectively.

4.5.1. Flexibility
The flexibility index is proposed to evaluate flexibility in SPENs. The flexibility index
has been developed during the past years and several publications explain it in details [17,75].
The flexibility index is related to the ability of a system to react at a variable price signal and,
thus, optimize the energy usage of a given system to minimize the energy cost.

•

The flexibility index is defined as the monetary savings that can be achieved by
adopting a flexible energy usage, for a given price-signal [82]. For example, given
a price-signal, a building or a neighbourhood obtaining a Flexibility Index of 0.1
means that the building or neighbourhood is able to save 10% of its energy costs, by
applying energy flexibility, for the given price signal. It shall be noted that, if the price
reflects the amount of CO2 emissions of the energy mix used as energy source, the
flexibility index is also representing the savings of CO2 emissions obtained through the
smart controller.

4.5.2. Smartness
The SRI [83] at the building level has been adopted by the EU as the main measure to evaluate how smart-ready buildings are (https://smartreadinessindicator.eu/
(accessed on 16 July 2021)). According to the executive summary [84] on the “Smart
Readiness Indicators”, the aim of the SRI is to “make the added value of building smartness more tangible for building users, owners, tenants and smart service providers”.
The roll-out scheme for the SRI implementation across the EU procedure was published
in October 2020 [85] The definition of Smartness in buildings can be adapted to the
neighbourhood level.

•

Smartness Readiness Indicator of a SPEN refers to the ability of a neighbourhood
(namely, its systems and buildings) to sense, interpret, communicate and actively
respond in an efficient manner to changing conditions in relation to the operation
of technical building systems or the external environment and to demands from
the occupants and the users of the different buildings and services. The readiness
of a neighbourhood to be smart is related to three aspects: adapting in response
to the needs of the occupants and users, facilitating the maintenance and efficient
operation processes and adapting in response to (price) signals from the grid. From
the practical point of view, it is suggested to compute the SRI for each building of a
SPEN, singularly.

5. Discussion
This paper presents two main contributions to the existing literature. The first one
is to put forth a consistent definition of Sustainable Plus Energy Neighbourhood (SPEN)

Energies 2021, 14, 4314

21 of 25

with the objective to make an active contribution to the ongoing debate on a common
understanding of what a Positive Energy District (PED) is and how it should be evaluated.
Acknowledging the positive benefits to act at larger scale than at individual buildings,
a SPEN is defined as a group of interconnected buildings with associated infrastructure,
located within both a confined functional area and/or virtual boundary. A SPEN aims
to reduce its direct and indirect energy use towards zero over an adopted complete year
with an increased use and production of renewable energy. Beyond the consideration of
the energy balance, several other aspects need to be considered to achieve a successfully
sustainable PED. Then, additionally, the definition of a SPEN covers the following five
main objectives:

•
•

•
•
•

The primary energy, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint reduction;
The active management of annual site or regional surplus production of renewable
energy and power performance (self-consumption, peak shaving, etc.) through smart
management and energy flexibility;
The cost efficiency and economic sustainability according to a life cycle assessment;
An improved indoor environment for well-being of the inhabitants; and
The social inclusiveness, interaction and empowerment related to co-use, shared
services and affordable living.

The second major contribution is to present an evaluation framework for the assessment of SPENs, to be applied both during the design phase and the operational phase to
monitor their performance. The evaluation framework defines five main categories and
the KPIs which are essential for the evaluation of SPENs are described with the rationale of
their selection. The selection of the main assessed categories and KPIs have been based on
a holistic and exhaustive methodology which highlights the multiple dimensions when
addressing sustainability in districts as moving beyond the traditional and strict building
energy assessment. The indicators set for each category were selected with the objective
to be diverse enough and to represent the SPEN goals in a balanced and integrated way.
Methodology is based on a tagging structure, DAGs and expert knowledge. A total number
of 38 KPIs that allow addressing the multidimensionality nature of SPENs are described
and distributed in five categories which are:

•
•
•
•
•

Energy and Environmental: addressing overall energy and environmental performance,
matching factors between load and on-site renewable generation and grid interaction;
Economic: addressing capital costs and operational costs;
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ): addressing thermal and visual comfort, as well
as indoor air quality;
Social indicators: addressing the aspects of equity, community and people; and
Smartness and Energy Flexibility: addressing the ability of manage energy in clusters
of buildings according sustainable objectives.

Our study provides additional support and considerable insight to large scale deployment of SPENs and PEDs. The next steps and further work will include the testing and
validation of the proposed assessment framework and the indicators in four real projects
across Europe, both in the integrated design phase and the operational phase. The projects
are real estate developments pursuing the SPEN’s objectives in four different climate zones
(Subartic, Marine, Mediterranean and Continental) with different housing contexts [1]. Our
research can be a useful aid for the design, construction and post-occupancy evaluation of
PEDs in an holistic way.
