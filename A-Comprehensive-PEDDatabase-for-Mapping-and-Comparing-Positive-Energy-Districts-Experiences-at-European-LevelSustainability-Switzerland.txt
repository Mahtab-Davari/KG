Abstract: Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are considered as one of the pioneer strategies to guide
cities in their energy planning process towards climate neutrality in an attractive, innovative and
human-centered way. The concept of PED is the result of a long co-creation process and integrates
several multidimensional features, aiming to promote the sustainable development of urban areas
and the transition of cities towards a climate neutral energy system. The paper provides an overview
of the first outcomes of WG1 “PED Mapping, Characterization and Learning”, in the research COST
Action CA19126 “Positive Energy Districts European Network” (PED-EU-NET). This study describes
activities that focus on creating a comprehensive PED-Database by mapping existing concepts,
strategies, projects, technological and non-technological solutions related to PEDs in Europe. The
main objective of the Database is to support municipalities through the decision-making process
by providing strategies for building and running a successful PED that can provide alternatives to
consider, and is powered by an interactive web-based map. The design of the Database framework
is supported by a step-by-step methodology adopted in the framework of the CA19126 in order to
develop the PED-Database as an interactive, updatable and user-friendly tool.

1. Introduction

iations.

The European Strategic Energy Technologies Plan, SET-Plan ACTION no. 3.2 Implementation Plan [1], is the technological pillar of European energy and climate policy, and
represents the main reference point for the promotion and spread of the Positive Energy
District (PED) strategy among EU Member States [2]. PEDs are considered as one of the
valuable strategies guiding cities in their integrated energy planning process towards
climate neutrality and to fulfill the European Green Deal goals [3,4] in collaboration with
citizens, a pillar that is promoted in the mission 100 Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030—by and
for the Citizens [5]. Therefore, the concept of PEDs integrates both the main paradigms of
smart and sustainable cities and will be incrementally introduced in the integrated energy
planning of many cities and communities in the coming years [6,7] as has been suggested
by the Renovation Wave [8].

This pioneering concept considers efforts among EU countries through the following
initiatives and projects:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The past Framework Programs (FP5–FP6–FP7), Horizon 2020 Program, the last Horizon Europe Program and European research and innovation missions (e.g., European
Green Deal), which foster international cooperation among European countries in the
field of Research and Innovation and support policy implementation while tackling
global challenges such as climate change and energy transition [9].
The Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe (JPI UE) and the EERA Joint Programme on Smart Cities (EERA JPSC) support the planning, deployment and replication of 100 PEDs with the objective sustainable urbanization by 2025 [10].
The “100 climate-neutral cities by 2030-by and for the citizens”, identifies the mission
for supporting, promoting and showcasing 100 European cities in their systemic
transition towards climate neutrality by 2030 and for the transformation of these cities
into experimental and innovative hubs for other cities [5,11].
The European partnership Driving Urban Transition (DUT) aims for a sustainable
future as an integral part of Horizon Europe’s strategic planning process, contributing
to strengthening the efforts towards viable urban development that translates multiple
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into local action [12].
The Smart Cities Marketplace (SCM) platform that was created by merging the two
former Commission projects “Marketplace of the European Innovation Partnership
on Smart Cities and Communities” (EIP-SCC) and the “Smart Cities Information
System” (SCIS), aims to bring cities, industries, SMEs, investors, researchers and other
smart-city actors together [13].
The European Regions Research and Innovation Network (ERRIN) [14] and the Eurocities [15] support the design of guidelines and the mobilization, replication and
mainstreaming of best practices in several cities.
The Covenant of Mayors and the Mayors Adapt, i.e., umbrella organisations for
Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) or Sustainable Energy and Climate Action
Plans (SECAPs), [16–18] and the Green City Accord [19] are Europe-wide initiatives
working in the local context in order to promote the integration of energy and environmental issues in urban planning, towards the achievement of a sustainable and
carbon-free society.
The COST Action CA19126 “Positive Energy Districts European Network (PED-EUNET)” [20,21] and the International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities (IEA-EBC) Annex 83 “PEDs” [22,23] are international initiatives focused
on developing an in-depth definition of PEDs, collecting the adopted technologies,
providing the planning tools and analyzing the decision-making processes related
to PEDs.

Even though different studies and practical experiences of PEDs focus on new development districts, in order to achieve Greenhouse Gasses (GHG) emissions reduction
goals by 2050 [24–26], it is necessary and urgent to undertake an ambitious transformation
process of the existing districts in a sustainable and climate-neutral direction [27–30]. Today,
75% of buildings in Europe are inefficient from the energy perspective, and their annual
retrofitting rate is estimated to be around 1% [8]. It is therefore necessary to intervene by
promoting a series of policy measures and funding schemes that enact changes to the built
environment with a systematic and integrated approach, some of which include:

•

•

at European level, action is being taken with regard to the revision of energy efficiency
policies, e.g., recasting the Renewable Energy Directive-RED II [31], and the promotion
of funding for energy transition and environmental sustainability, e.g., funds allocated
from the Next Generation EU Programme [32] and Fit for 55 package [33];
at the National level, individual countries are required to draw up National Energy
and Climate Plans (NECPs), specifying the ways in which they intend to foster energy
efficiency in different sectors, to promote the use of renewable sources and to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions [34]. Simultaneously, some countries have established

Sustainability 2022, 14, 427

3 of 24

•

conspicuous funds to support the retrofitting and the efficiency of the existing built
environment, e.g., Italy 110% incentives [35];
at the local level, municipalities are working to overcome a planning system divided
into sectoral silos and to improve their interaction with the public sector, thereby becoming able to invest in and implement strategies tailored at local context. In this sense,
business and governance models that support the concrete implementation of renewal
interventions are promoted, e.g., realization of One-Stop-Shop, promotion of Turnkeys
and Cornerstone and diffusion of the Public-Private Partnership model [36,37]. These
models must be based on the improvement of services, technologies, quality of life
and comfort of the inhabitants, policies or on urban management between the public
and private sectors; these requirements necessitate different capabilities to those in
traditional governments [21].

Within the SET-Plan no.3.2, an open-ended and broad definition of the PED concept is
introduced: ‘PED is seen as a district with annual net zero energy import, and net zero CO2
emission working towards an annual local surplus production of renewable energy’ [1]
(p.5). According to this definition, PEDs can integrate several multidimensional features
aiming to boost urban areas’ sustainable development, and to support cities transition
towards a climate neutral energy system. The key features within the definition of PED,
developed by the EERA JPSC and JPI Urban Europe [2], include and extend to the wide
vision of the precursor PED projects from previous Framework Programs (FP5–FP6–FP7),
and more recently, Horizon 2020 on Smart Cities and Communities (SCC) Lighthouse
projects [38–45].
Hence, most of the studies and PEDs are available on the EU SCM platform [13] and
the JPI UE “Booklet of Positive Energy Districts in Europe” [46], which are, in general,
referred to the multidimensional perspective of PEDs, mainly based on the technologies and
lessons learnt from these experiences at the European level. Even if these works are very
relevant for mapping PED and for the creation of a structured repository of information,
they do not fully address the complex set of urban challenges and the objective to support
decision making, the implementation and replication of PEDs in municipalities, nor the
creation of capacity and community building to drive urban transformations.
Despite the above-mentioned efforts, PED concept has yet to be standardized, and
reference for PED archetypes need to be consolidated [47]. Indeed, as it can be seen in
Table 1 below, four categories of PEDs have been established until now (Autonomous-PED,
Dynamic-PED, Virtual-PED and Candidate-PED) [48,49], focusing on two main aspects:

•
•

the boundaries of the PED in order to reach a net positive yearly energy balance;
the energy exchanges (import/export) in order to compensate energy balance for
surpluses and shortages between the buildings or the wider grid outside.

Besides, some of the main gaps still under discussion are related to PED boundary
definition, in order to quantify the energy exchanged in real applications and ecosystems.
At the same time, the type of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) need to be assessed, since
they are tackled in different ways by ongoing projects and programs across Europe [50–54].
The CA19126 “PED-EU-NET” aims to drive the deployment of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) in Europe by harmonising, sharing, and disseminating knowledge and breakthroughs on PEDs across different stakeholders, domains (technological, environmental,
social, economic, financial, legal and regulatory) and sectors (energy, transport, buildings,
industry). It will support cities and empower communities to achieve the city-wide positive
energy transition with pioneering ideas, methods and solutions. This Action is divided
into four interlinked Working Groups (WGs) structured as follows: WG1 “PED Mapping,
Characterization and Learning”, WG2 “PED Guides and Tools”, WG3 “PED Laboratories,
Monitoring and Replication” and WG4 “Dissemination, Outreach and Exploitation”.

Table 1. PED categories and related definitions.
PED-Categories

Definitions

Source

Autonomous-PED

the PED has a positive power balance within its geographic
boundaries and is designed to be self-managing (regardless
of power from the periphery) or can even help
manage/balance the external grid.

[48,49]

Dynamic-PED

the PED has a positive energy balance within its geographic
limits, exchanging energy with the periphery to compensate
for energy excesses and deficits.

[48,49]

Virtual-PED

the PED has a positive energy balance within its virtual
limits, exchanging energy with the periphery to compensate
for energy excesses and deficits.

[48,49]

Candidate-PED

the PED has no positive energy balance within its
geographic boundaries, but energy balance is achieved by
importing certified green energy (i.e., demarcating a zero
emissions district).

[49]

Specifically, the WG1, as argued in this paper, aims to create a consolidated knowledge
pool on the state-of-the-art development in PEDs and, based on the existing information,
it devises methods to characterize PEDs and to recommend best practices for their implementation. Within WG1, the activities related to task 1.1 focus on creating a comprehensive
PED-Database for use as an interactive, updatable and user-friendly tool by mapping
existing concepts, strategies, projects, laboratories, and technological and non-technological
innovations related to PEDs in Europe. To develop a common Database that includes both
PED cases and PED initiatives as well as PED Labs, a collaborative study has been carried
out between the WG1 and WG3.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2, “Objective”, outlines the main PEDDatabase’s aims, clarifying that the Database is conceived as an operative tool targeted
mainly towards municipalities, but also for researchers and professionals who want to
explore and deepen the concept of PEDs. In Section 3, dedicated to “Methodology”,
the PED-Database realization process is presented. Section 4, “Results”, highlights the
realization of the PED-Database framework and introduces its online implementation in
the form of an interoperable web platform. In Section 5, the “Discussions and Future
developments” are provided, and in Section 6, the “Conclusions” are presented.
2. Objectives
As already mentioned above, the activities of Task 1.1 focus on the implementation of a
well-structured and operative tool that map, analyse and compare PED-relevant experiences
and concepts in the European context, considering that a PED-Database does not yet exist.
The database is developed for non-commercial purposes and will be open source.
The PED-Database’s design pursues the following objectives:

•

•

•

•

Co-creation of a PED innovation eco-system that, moving from the agreed definition, will uncover information and indicators (both expected and/or assessed performances), and facilitate the implementation of PEDs around Europe.
Systematization of the information in order to address specific needs and targets from
an inclusive set of stakeholders engaged in each phase of the PED implementation
process.
Supporting the creation of capacity building, based on broader knowledge derived
from innovation and lessons learnt to overcome barriers and take advantage of opportunities derived from the advanced mapping of solutions and performance, obtained
in previous or ongoing experiences on PEDs.
Envisioning the needs (demand aggregation) and expected strategies to adopt (scenarios of intervention) a more effective energy planning process and decision-making,

•

which are able to promote and facilitate the achievement of large-scale sustainability
conscious urban areas.
Supporting municipalities and researchers in the PED-implementation process, considering both the renewal of existing areas and the realization of new, sustainable, energy
efficient and net-zero GHG emissions urban development.

The PED-Database is configured as a multidisciplinary and open tool, that starts
from the aggregation and systematization of the gathered information, then returns a
set of multiple features related to the PED concept, including both technological and
non-technological innovations. Therefore, the designed framework is systematized in a
way in which the information collected provides an overall picture of case studies and
implemented projects.
The paper presents and discusses the step-by-step methodology to guide PED Database
realization. Until now, PED-Database structure and the main parameters to be collected
were identified and agreed on among a core group of experts on the topic. The next working step will lead to concrete Database implementation through data collection and the
characterizing of best practices relevant to PED (case study, project, initiatives, strategies,
technological and non-technological solutions, etc).
3. Methodology
The PED-Database was conceived of as a cross disciplinary contribution among the
CA19126 Working Groups (WG2, WG3 and WG4) and foresaw the alignment with both IEAEBC Annex83 and JPI UE-other international initiatives focused on PEDs implementationusing a collaborative approach (Table 2).

According to Figure 1, Database realization can be summarised using two main
working phases. The first aimed at defining PED Database general framework and at
mapping PED-relevant projects and initiatives among all CA19126 partners. While the
second phase, using the developed framework, focused on the realization of the web
platform that will host the PED-Database and on its implementation, starting with the
mapped PED-relevant projects and initiatives.
3.1. Phase 1
As a first step, in order to define the PED-Database scope from specific target groups
and its main requirements, a workshop comprising WG1 members was held in order to
collect ideas, expectations and directions for Database development. Task.1.1, moving from
this list, performed a comparative analysis of different relevant databases and platforms
to understand the kind of structure and content a PED-Database should have, so as to
meet key stakeholder needs and expectations. Table 3 provides the key parameters and
questions investigated.

with high aspiration in terms of energy efficiency, energy flexibility and energy production.
The PED discussed (its demo sites/case studies) does not necessarily have to meet an
annual energy positive balance, if it meets at least several other major aspects of PED
Framework definition ‘Positive Energy Districts are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban
areas or groups of connected buildings which produce net zero greenhouse gas emissions and actively
manage an annual local or regional surplus production of renewable energy. They require integration
of different systems and infrastructures and interaction between buildings, the users and the regional
energy, mobility and ICT systems, while securing the energy supply and a good life for all in line
with social, economic and environmental sustainability’ [2] (p. 7).
According to the definition, PED-relevant projects and initiatives were collected among
COST partners and a systematic analysis and screening were performed, identifying the
following two main categories:

•
•

PED-focused: projects/initiatives directly focused on Positive Energy Districts implementation. They are in line with the PED Framework Definition.
PED-supporting: projects/initiatives not directly focused on Positive Energy Districts.
However, they collect experiences assimilable to the PED concept, such as energy
communities, smart districts, local energy districts, sustainable and resilient neighbourhood. They do not cover all the aspects mentioned in PED Framework Definition.

Appendix B lists PED-focused and PED-supporting projects and initiatives collected in
COST Consortium and, for each of them, it reports the following key information: acronym,
title, period, scale, number of case studies and sources.
3.2. Phase 2
The second phase, as shown in Figure 1, involved two parallel processes: (1) an
individual questionnaire and parameter development for data collection and (2) IT solution
development of the PED-Database online platform.
Specific questionnaires for sections A, B, C and D have been compiled and individual
parameters are defined in a supplementing glossary in four rounds. In the first round, the
WG1 collected contributions from its members. Secondly, the list of parameters was exchanged with WG2 and WG3 and PED Lab parameters developed by WG3 were integrated
as a specific sub-set to the questionnaire. Furthermore, Task 3.1 of WG3 also provided
information obtained in its workshops related to drivers and barriers to feed the common
sections of the questionnaire. In the third step, a task group established among COST
Action and Annex 83 (Subtask D) was created to manage the alignment of the PED-EU-NET
Database parameter list with another list of parameters corroborated by Annex 83 team.
Fourth, a pilot testing of the questionnaire took place to gather additional inputs from WG1
members and JPI UE. This piloting brought feedback and partial inputs to both parameter
definitions and questionnaire structure and user friendliness. Further alignment of the
questionnaires and parameter lists with other partners such as JPI UE is also foreseen as
the Database evolves.
In parallel to questionnaire and parameter list development, an IT solution for the
PED-Database online platform was formulated, comprising the following three components: input forms (i.e., online representation of the questionnaires), database frontend
(i.e., user interface for online data visualization) and database backend for PED-Database
administration. The input form component builds on the adapted structure using the letter
identifiers (A–D) introduced by WG3 online questionnaire and programmed by Centro
de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas (CIEMAT) Information
Technology Department [55]. After the CIEMAT structure and online form were assessed,
the input form was newly programmed and adjusted to become an embedded sub-section
of the PED-EU-NET website. The other two components (presentation frontend and administration backend) were developed in multiple iterations by an external provider according
to the requirements list compiled by WG1.

4.2. PED-Database Data Collection
The selection of the main parameters (i.e., assessed information and KPIs) is based on
a holistic and exhaustive methodology which highlights the multiple dimensions related
to PEDs, for which definitions and characterization are quite broad in the context of the
on-going international debate [48]. This is managed by identifying the main categories
that address its multidimensionality nature and the specific insights from each project
and initiative according to an inclusive adherence to the PED approach definition in the
EU countries.

The questionnaires for PED-Database data collection are supplemented by a detailed
Glossary providing definitions related to each parameter and the related KPIs. The Glossary’s main purpose is to provide definitions and references to enable better consistency of
the data and information collected for the PED Database. The Glossary will be provided to
the respondents during the information-collection process in the form of explanatory text,
in order to avoid confusion during the self-filling of the online questionnaire.
4.3. PED-Database Online Platform
All of the efforts that have been conducted under PED-Database creation will lead
to the release of an online platform accessible from the PED-EU-NET website. The full
release is planned for 2022. This platform will act as a unified database for identifying
PEDs and PED Labs in the EU. Once the database is implemented, another research paper
will be developed to present the quantitative and qualitative data derived from the PED
case studies and PED Labs included in the database.
In this section, the format of the PED-Database online platform will be presented.
The platform, as already mentioned, has been developed in three components: (1) online
input form, (2) database frontend (i.e., user interface for online data visualization) and
(3) database backend for PED-Database administration.
4.3.1. Online Input Form
Structured in line with the questionnaires described in Section 4.1. The form will be
accessible to database respondents based on a link provided by the Database editor. An
additional advantage to the standard online forms, e.g., an EU Survey [56], is the embeddedness and seamless connection with the frontend and backend for data visualization.
It is complemented by the following additional features: navigation key plan, summary
overview of input values before submission.
4.3.2. Database Frontend for Data Visualization
In the release-candidate version, the PED case studies, and PED Labs are accessible
using map view, based on OpenStreet Map and table view (see Figure 5).

4.3.3. Database Backend for Administration
The system foresees the role of a Database editor (PED-EU-NET authorized user) and
input from editors (any database contributor without need for registration). The editor’s
task is to invite input form editors and review the submitted input forms before publication
in the Database frontend. Since all the information and data provided by the contributors
(input form editors) are intended to be publicly available to anyone, this process serves as a
minimum for quality assurance.
5. Discussion and Future Developments
This research supports Municipalities in passing from an integrated energy planning
stage to the implementation of strategies towards the climate neutrality target, by using
an attractive, innovative and human-centered approach. This approach facilitates the
decision-making process by providing information on the available district resources, the
solutions and innovations adopted, urban directives, implementation processes, expected
and measured metrics, or associated drivers and barriers. The transition process needs to
consider contextual and regional factors in order to achieve favorable PED implementations
with low resource investments and utilization of local resources.
The designed PED-Database introduces definitions and insights that will guide cities’
stakeholders in the creation of capacity at different levels as well as by defining core
capabilities. The developed framework provides an understanding of the state of play and
PED concept directions, views, values and functionality to create a learning environment
for capacity building and, at the same time, to establish a vision for tomorrow.
PED concepts must be highly structured, based on local resources, with the high
involvement of urban stakeholders and should be strongly linked to global governance
models for which no factor can be left out.
Indeed, in this PED scenario, several stakeholders are required to cooperate in a
strategical PED vision, where technological and non–technological solutions are tightly
connected. It is necessary to consider citizens’ needs and challenges, through the process of
authorization and the realization of both public and private buildings intervention, with
the involvement of the relative municipal officers. Local citizens’ associations play a role in
enhancing opportunities and synergies in the social field that can arise in a PED context.
Alongside the non-technological elements, there is also a link to the choices of efficiency,
energy flexibility, RES-production, storage, reducing CO2 emissions and any other element
as recorded in the associated technological aspects and innovations section of the PED
Database. These PED scenarios can be contextualized within the creation of an energy
citizenship community, as well.
The PED-Database provides a balanced overview of the technological and non–
technological solutions that require the cooperative involvement of several stakeholders,
and those that collect the key resources, making sure that such resources are effectively
integrated. The capacity building process encourages participation by all those involved.
Through the capacity building process, each stakeholder can learn to develop an element of
the PED in close connection with all partners. This is why a PED needs a strategical shared
vision among all the actors of the process.
A well-structured form of data collection is the starting point to reach this goal. This
task requires external assistance from PED developers who are in charge and responsible
for the gathered information (e.g., researchers, energy vendors, DSO, TSO, aggregate, technology providers, etc.), auditors (e.g., technical architect in charge, energy audit company,
consulting expert) or any other actors within a public–private partnership who are actively
involved in the projects.
Aligned with this target, COST Action ‘PED-EU-NET’ has developed pioneer initiatives in conducting research on PEDs and aligning the identified parameters with their
expertise and their ongoing research on the generation of PED Databases. Since there
are overlaps and gaps in their research, an alignment process is essential to balance the
work load for experts (developers of the Databases) and city authorities (who are trying

Sustainability 2022, 14, 427

15 of 24

to answer questions of the parameters and indicators). On the other hand, knowledge
and experience sharing are necessary in order to maximize the benefit to target groups in
terms of advancing the scientific, technological and social awareness as well as to realise
the added value generated by networking at a pan-European level and beyond.
With this intent, the first urban stakeholders workshop held by the PED-EU-NET in
Rome in early October 2021 proved to be an example of an efficient platform for exchange
and a stimulus for cooperation among different types of stakeholders.
The PED-Database is intended for release in 2022. The collaboration among the PEDEU-NET WGs the Database is expected to grow further, in two respects. First, the data
collection will be initiated with PED-relevant case studies and widened over time. Second,
new sections will be added to the database in the coming years, based on the framework
(especially the sections E and F) of national level and technological and non-technological
solutions and tools.
This Action will run until the end of 2024, and the leadership has been assessing the
options of maintaining the database after that. The COST Action website needs to be kept
open and the data should remain available for two years after the end of COST Action.
After the end of COST Action, it might be possible to transfer the Database to another host,
e.g., European Energy Research Alliance or other European initiatives that the COST works
closely with.
6. Conclusions
The methodology developed for the generation of a PED Database, and its structural
format have been developed under CA 19126 by WG1 leaders and T1.1 leaders. Moreover,
the WG3 team contributed to the parameters regarding the PED LABs. The main advantage
of the PED-Database is its use as an operative tool, targeted mainly for use in municipalities,
but also for researchers and professionals who want to explore configure PED concepts.
The framework of the PED-Database comprises the implementation process, starting with
the identification of the definition scope, the main requirements, a development of the
parameters that characterize PEDs and generates the glossary for defining each parameter.
The PED projects/initiatives are listed by the COST partners, resources as to identify
the resources that are available that would feed the Database. At the implementation
stage, questionnaires are generated regarding global characteristics, technological and nontechnological aspects, PEDs/PED-LABs detailing, Main Barriers, Enablers and Stakeholders
and General Projects.
The results will be highlighted for the realization of the PED-Database framework
and its online implementation in the form of a web interoperable platform. The platform
is still under construction and will be finalized soon after the data collection phase. The
Database Editors will review the gather data and transform them into an understandable,
common language that will be displayed in the platform. The sustainability of the Database
is critical in terms of contributions and research, and, for this reason, we have planned to
maintain the Database after the Action lifetime, as it will be adopted by another host that
works closely with Action group.
This intensive research on defining a framework for characterizing PEDs by definition,
concept boundary, strategies and technological and non-technological innovations utilized
facilitates a cross disciplinary working environment within the CA19126 WG1 team. The
alignment efforts with the pioneer initiatives (IEA-EBC Annex 83 and JPI UE) will result
in an overarching approach within the PED environment, since there are still overlaps
or conflicts on the concept of PEDs. A unified database for mapping, filtering, sorting,
comparing and benchmarking PED planning or implementations will help decision makers
or experts in realizing the main concept.
Once the PED case studies and PED LABs are implemented in the Database, the
CA19126 WG1 team plans to develop another publication on the collected data and results.
