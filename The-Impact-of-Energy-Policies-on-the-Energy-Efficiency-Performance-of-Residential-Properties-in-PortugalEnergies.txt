Abstract: The effect of energy policies on the energy performance of residential properties/houses
in nineteen Portuguese districts from 2014 to 2021 was investigated. A linear random-effects model
regression was used as the method in this empirical investigation. The empirical results indicated
that the income per capita has a negative effect on residential properties with high energy efficiency
certificates (e.g., A+, A, and B) and a positive impact on residential properties with low energy
efficiency certificates (e.g., C, D, E, and F); the codes and standards energy policies for energy
efficiency have a positive effect on residential properties with high energy efficiency certificates
(e.g., A, B, and B−) and residential properties with low energy efficiency certificates (e.g., C, D,
E, and F); the fiscal and financial incentive policies for energy efficiency have a positive effect on
residential properties with high energy efficiency certificates (e.g., A+, A, and B) and a negative
effect on residential properties with B− energy certificate, and also a negative effect on residential
properties with low energy efficiency certificates (e.g., C and D) and a positive effect on residential
properties with an F energy certificate; the information and education policies of energy efficiency
have a positive effect on residential properties with high energy efficiency certificates (e.g., A+, A,
and B) and residential properties with low energy efficiency certificates (e.g., C, D, and E); and,
finally, the consumer credit per capita has a positive effect on residential properties with high energy
efficiency certificates (e.g., A+, A, and B) and a negative effect on residential properties with low
energy efficiency certificates (e.g., C, D, and F), as well as a positive effect on residential properties
with an F energy certificate.

Although energy consumption is a key element of economic development, high energy
consumption has caused climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, countries,
including those in the European Union (EU), have based their policies on energy efficiency.
In most countries, a significant percentage of the total final energy consumption is related
to the residential sector. Although energy consumption in the building sector of Europe has
not increased significantly in recent years, 40% of the total energy consumption in Europe,
about one-third of the emissions of greenhouse gas, and 36% of the carbon emissions,
which all cause climate change, are due to energy consumption in the residential sector

(e.g., De- Boeck et al. [1], Wang et al. [2], Li et al. [3], and the European Commission [4]).
Numerous factors affect energy consumption in the residential sector, which has made
this sector complex [5]. So, the residential sector is the main target of many EU energy
efficiency policies and an excellent opportunity to decrease energy consumption. Indeed,
the residential sector has made the most progress in energy efficiency compared to other
sectors. On the other hand, the most economical method of reducing energy consumption
in buildings is achieved through energy efficiency measures (e.g., Ramos et al. [6], PabloRomero et al. [7], and Palma et al. [5]). Given the impact of the building sector on the
environment, the study of energy efficiency in this sector should focus on energy policies.
Southern European countries, such as Portugal, have different economic, cultural, and
climatic characteristics than northern European countries. The final energy consumption
for cooling and heating in the residential sector is very different in European countries,
and southern European buildings are less adaptable to severe climate change than northern European buildings. In addition, there are many concerns about energy efficiency
in southern European countries due to the increasing demand for cooling and heating
systems [5]. Therefore, the study of southern European countries can provide different and
important results for implementing policies. On the other hand, a case study is necessary
to provide policies following the climatic characteristics of each country. In a southern
European country (Portugal), the residential sector consumes 18.2% of the total energy
consumption [8].
The Energy Performance Guidelines for buildings are a popular policy initiative
proposed by the European Union to address climate change and energy efficiency issues.
One of these measures is the directive for using energy performance certificates (EPCs) to
analyse the residential sector energy performance (e.g., Abela et al. [9] and Lee et al. [10]).
The European Commission introduced the EPC building directive in 2002, which required
member countries to implement EPC certifications [11]. The purpose of providing these
guidelines is information transparency and reducing asymmetries in the information
concerning the energy efficiency of residential units, to achieve the goals of improving
energy efficiency and reducing the energy consumption of buildings [12]. Transparency
of information on energy efficiency leads owners of residential units to provide EPC
certification to potential buyers and tenants at the time of sale and rent. With EPCs, buyers
and tenants can easily access fast, reliable, and accessible information (e.g., Lee et al. [10],
Gouveia and Palma [13], Dell-Anna et al. [14], and Franke and Nadler [15]). Therefore,
EPCs evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of the building. In addition, an EPC
can encourage people to renovate their buildings to save energy [3].
Residential property owners are interested in getting higher EPCs because buildings
with higher EPCs have higher prices due to higher energy efficiency (e.g., Brounen and
Kok [16], Cajias and Piazolo [17], Hyland et al. [18], Fuerst et al. [19], and Stanley et al. [20]).
On the other hand, according to the European Commission, renovation can save up to 46%
of the energy consumption [4]. Therefore, the EPC rating process encourages the owners
to save energy by upgrading their building energy efficiency. It also presents an occasion
to train them about energy efficiency and recommends various actions that can quickly
improve the energy performance of residential units to owners. With a small investment in
energy efficiency, technologies can easily be upgraded to a higher EPC (e.g., Collins and
Curtis [12] and Comerford et al. [21]). Unfortunately, there is no standard framework for
EPC delivery in member countries [14].
The building energy certification system was implemented in Portugal in 2008, where
all new residential buildings were required to have an energy performance certificate [22].
Moreover, since 2009, it is mandatory in Portugal that all buildings have a valid energy
certificate. Therefore, the EPCs became mandatory in the country with Decree-Law no.
(118/2013) of 20 August 2013, which follows Directive (2010/31/EU). As a result, Portugal
issued 13,799 certificates in 2008, and in 2020 issued 198,090 (see Figure 1 below).

scales of space and time and provide new policies and insights for other countries [32]. Portugal is a good and interesting case study for several reasons: (1) The level of access to EPC
databases varies in different European countries, but the Portuguese database is one of the

Energies 2022, 15, 802

6 of 24

first databases. (2) Many Portuguese buildings are old and were built before 1990, affecting
energy consumption. About 50% of buildings in Portugal need renovation, so some studies
have considered the issues and problems related to Portugal’s energy shortage to be related
to its residential sector (e.g., Simoes et al. [33], Gouveia et al. [32], and Palma et al. [5]).
Portugal was one of the first countries to adopt the EPC guidelines and implement them
fully and correctly in its own country. So, consumers in Portugal have much information
about EPCs. In addition, Portugal is warmer than northern European countries, which
significantly affects consumer preferences for EPC properties. The residential sector’s
final energy consumption per capita of Portugal is lower than the European mean, even
in countries with comparable climates such as Spain and Italy (e.g., Ramos et al. [6] and
Palma et al. [5]). Therefore, a case study of Portugal can provide interesting and meaningful
results for policymakers.
Most studies of European countries have examined one or two variables of energy
efficiency policy. In this study, to complete the previous studies and fill the gap of prior
studies, the effect of several energy efficiency policies on energy performance in the residential sector of a southern European country was considered. To our knowledge, our
study is the first one that analyses the impact of energy efficiency policies on residential
properties’ energy performance in Portugal. This study, therefore, goes a step further and
develops an analysis of energy efficiency policies.
According to the above, in this paper, we seek to answer whether energy efficiency
policies affect the energy efficiency performance of residential properties/houses in nineteen Portuguese districts from 2014 to 2021. Which energy efficiency policy variables have
the most significant effect on energy efficiency in the Portuguese building sector? To answer
this question, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of energy efficiency
policies on the energy performance of residential properties in Portugal. While the analysis
in this article is specific to Portugal, it has far-reaching policy implications. Any success,
challenge, or impact of energy efficiency policies on EPCs in a country is a helpful lesson
for officials in other European countries similar to Portugal to improve the energy efficiency
of residential properties. In addition, the policy implications of this article help direct
investment in optimal opportunities to improve Portugal’s energy efficiency. This study
also provides insights and helpful information for national and local stakeholders and
political decision-makers.
This investigation is divided into six sections. Section 2 presents the literature review;
Section 3 describes the data and model used in this empirical investigation; Section 4 shows
the empirical results; Section 5 presents the discussion; and, finally, Section 6 presents the
conclusions and policy implications.
2. Literature Review
This section reviews previous studies on energy efficiency policies in the housing
sector. Past studies revealed that different policies had been implemented to increase
energy efficiency (e.g., Alberini and Bigano [34], Aydin and Brounen [35], Charlier [36],
Dubois and Allacker [37], Filippini et al. [27], Lopes et al. [38], and Ramos et al. [6]). These
policies include, for example, energy performance standards; required labels of energy
efficiency for appliances and building standards; fiscal, regulatory, and information policies;
tax credits; energy certificates; energy feedback programs; subsidies for renovation; and
subsidies for building new houses.
Most studies conducted to review energy efficiency policies in the housing sector have
been conducted for a panel of countries. However, some studies have evaluated energy
efficiency policies in the housing sector for EU countries. For example, Filippini et al. [27]
explored the impact of energy policy instruments on energy efficiency in the EU housing
sector during 1996–2009. In this research, econometric approaches of energy demand
modelling and boundary analysis have been used. The empirical analysis revealed that
financial incentives and energy performance standards play a crucial part in promoting
energy efficiency.

Energies 2022, 15, 802

7 of 24

In contrast, the enlightening actions do not affect it. Thonipara et al. [29] examined
the energy efficiency policies of residential buildings in the European Union. The results
showed that construction regulations are an effective policy tool to reduce energy consumption in residential buildings. However, the impact of regulatory standards for new
buildings and major renovations is only visible over more extended periods. Carbon and
energy taxes are effective in improving energy efficiency. Broin et al. [30] examined the
energy efficiency policies of the EU housing sector during the period 1990–2010. The effects
of policies have generally been discussed in fiscal, regulatory and information policies. The
correlation between real demand decline and the estimated impact of regulatory policies is
stronger than the correlation with the implications of fiscal and information policies. Given
the energy efficiency market barriers in the residential sector, the results support that the
regulatory policy is the main concern in designing successful paths in the direction of the
EU’s broader targets for heating energy.
Several other studies that examined a panel of countries evaluated European countries
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Aydin and
Brounen [35] examined the impact of residential energy efficiency policies on household
energy consumption across Europe from 1980 to 2016. In this study, electrical and nonelectrical energy consumption was examined separately because households usually use
these items for different purposes (appliances and heating) and are subject to different
energy efficiency policies. They focused on two distinct mandatory energy efficiency labels
for household appliances and building standards. It was revealed that home appliances’
strict building regulations and energy labelling requirements reduce residential energy
consumption. Bertoldi and Mosconi [39] studied the impact of energy efficiency policies on
energy storage in 29 European countries during 1990–2013. Their results show that in the
absence of energy efficiency policies, energy consumption in Europe in 2013 would have
been about 12% higher. Finally, Costantini et al. [40] examined the impact of policies on
energy efficiency technologies for the residential sector in 23 OECD countries from 1990 to
2010. Evidence showed that innovation in energy efficiency technologies is driven by both
demand policy tools and technological pressure. Most importantly, the evidence presented
shows that the simple adding of an uncontrolled number of policy tools simultaneously
can reduce the effectiveness of the policy mix.
In other studies, researchers compared the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies
between the two countries. Kern et al. [41] examined policy instruments to stimulate energy
efficiency in Finland and the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2014. The results show that
both countries increasingly have complex policy mixes that include various goals and
tools and use a wide range of different tools to encourage users to reduce their energy
consumption. Huang et al. [42] compared energy-saving policies in the housing sector
between Japan and China. Related policies fall into four categories: control and regulatory
instruments, economic/market-based instruments, financial and information instruments,
and voluntary measures. The effect of the policy analysis showed that energy-saving
policies in the housing sector led to energy savings in both Japan and China. Comparing the
barriers showed that Japan and China have many barriers, including high transaction costs
and a lack of usable methods. Compared to Japan, China suffers from more obstacles, such
as inefficient implementation, insufficient information and awareness, and an immature
financial regulation system.
In the meantime, several studies on energy efficiency policies have been conducted
nationally. Beerepoot and Beerepoot [43] examined their government’s strict regulations
to motivate improvements in energy performance in the Dutch building sector during
the period 1996–2003. The results show that energy performance policy in the Netherlands has not helped to disseminate or develop innovations in hot-water technologies.
To some extent, it helps to improve the efficiency of conventional hot-water production
technologies. Related factors, such as changes in gas prices or housing investment, also
have hardly impacted incremental or new energy consumption in the Dutch residential
building. Boonekamp [44] examined the results of the Netherlands household energy

Energies 2022, 15, 802

efficiency policies from 1990 to 2003. The author also deals with the quantitative analysis
of the interactions between three main measures: (i) the regulatory energy tax; (ii) investment subsidies; and (iii) gas regulation used to heat the place. The results showed that
combining two or three policies is 13–30% less effective than all the effects of individual
measures. In another study for the Netherlands, Murphy [45] used policy tools to improve
the energy efficiency in private homes. The results showed that the current tools to create a
long-run energy-saving plan for present homes are weak. In addition, most tools appear
and disappear over short periods and cannot form a coherent and integrated strategy that
continuously targets existing dwellings.
Yu et al. [46], in a study considering the Global Change Evaluation Model, examined
the growth in the building sector and the impact of building energy policies in Gujarat
(India). The results show that without developing energy incentive policies, the energy
consumption could strongly increase in commercial and residential buildings from 2010
to 2050 in Gujarat. Indeed, realising the Energy Saving Building Law can increase energy
efficiency in commercial buildings and reduce building electricity consumption in Gujarat
by 20% by 2050. Contrasted to the no-policy scenario, having energy codes for commercial
and residential buildings can save 10% electricity consumption. Alberini and Bigano [34]
examined the motivations for promoting residential energy in Italy. The study used data
collected from 3000 Italian landlords between May and June 2013. The results showed that
non-monetary incentives have little effect on increasing energy efficiency and monetary
incentives are generally not cost-effective, even under the optimistic assumptions contained
in Italy’s tax credit program. Li and Shui [47] conducted a comprehensive analysis of
building energy efficiency policies concerning improving energy performance, the standard
of living, and mitigating climate change in China. The results showed that the analysis
emphasises the importance of ensuring policy compliance within the current regulatory
framework to maximise the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies in the Chinese-made
environment. Kamal et al. [48] researched the energy efficiency policies’ roles in the housing
sector in Qatar using the system dynamic method. Seven energy efficiency policy measures
based on renovation and new constructions were evaluated for these buildings to see
their effects on electricity consumption. The results showed that building energy-intensive
facilities and renovating old buildings every ten years could save more than 4700 gigawatthours of electricity by 2050.
Ramos et al. [6] review the empirical evidence focusing on energy certifications,
feedback programs, and energy audits. As the findings revealed, the energy certifications
and feedback programs could be successful. Nevertheless, this only will occur if they
are carefully designed. In contrast, the evidence supports that the effectiveness of energy
audits is mixed. Charlier [36] examined the impact of tax credits and energy burdens on
the energy efficiency costs of the residential sector. Due to the complexity of studying
decision-making to invest in energy-saving renovations, a two-variable Tobit model was
used to compare decisions about energy-saving. The findings confirmed that tax credits
were unsuccessful in distributing incentives. Therefore, the government public policy
should focus on low-income residents. Finally, Dubois and Allacker [37] evaluated the
efficacy of three economic instruments to increase energy efficiency in the housing sector:
(i) reconstruction subsidies; (ii) demolition and reconstruction project subsidies; and (iii) the
construction of new housing subsidies. The results show that renovation subsidies, with
low energy gains, worsen the overall housing energy consumption due to inefficient energy
homes. Therefore, the use of policy tools requires structural changes.
Pasichnyi et al. [49] analysed the data quality assurance method for energy performance certificates (EPCs). The analysis showed that EPC data could be improved by
adding or revising the EPC features and ensuring the interoperability of the EPC dataset.
Shen et al. [50] researched the current development of policy instruments to promote energy efficiency (compulsory enforcement instruments, economic incentives, and voluntary
design instruments) (BEE) by examining their performance in seven selected countries and
regions. The results showed that different countries had made good progress in building

Energies 2022, 15, 802

9 of 24

energy efficiency by adopting different policy instruments. Boza-Kiss et al. [51] stated that
while specific instruments such as product standards and labels can achieve the greatest
energy savings, in terms of cost-effectiveness, it is not possible to prioritise the policy
instruments under consideration. McCormick and Neij [52] collected policy instruments for
energy efficiency in buildings in Nordic countries. This study focuses on policy instruments,
including building codes, subsidies, labels and flyers, information campaigns, and taxes.
Trotta et al. [28] had identified policy instruments and private initiatives in five European countries (Finland, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). The results show
that the British government has implemented better policies with private sector initiatives
to improve energy efficiency. However, Finland’s scarcity of effective and directed policies
has raised energy consumption. In Hungary, Italy, and Spain, interesting initiatives were
found (for example, financial incentives). Nair et al. [53] analysed the factors affecting
the energy efficiency investment in the Swedish construction sector. The findings showed
that personal characteristics, for instance, income, education, house age, thermal discomfort, past investment, and perceived energy cost, affect the homeowners’ preference for a
particular energy efficiency measure. Amstalden et al. [54] examined the effects of policy
instruments on energy efficiency in the Swiss residential sector. The findings indicated that
Swiss policy instruments drive investments to increase energy efficiency.
Houde and Aldy [55] examine the increasing impact of energy subsidies on the presence of policy expression in the United States. The results showed that, in general, the
impact of this subsidy program on long-term energy demand is probably negligible. Tambach et al. [56] examined Dutch energy policy instruments for the building sector. The
results show that although Dutch energy policy instruments for present housing appear
to meet local executive demands largely, complementary policy instruments are required
to encourage and pressure the current modernisation regime. Lindén et al. [57] stated
that policy instruments had enhanced the energy efficiency behaviour in Sweden, namely,
extensive information campaigns during the oil crisis of the 1970s and the labelling of
household energy. Finally, Murphy et al. [58] reviewed policy instruments to improve
energy performance in the Dutch construction sector. The results indicated that the existing
instruments are not outfitted to create a long-run energy-saving plan for current homes.
As can be seen, although previous studies have used variables, methods, countries,
regions, and time series to explain the impact of energy efficiency policies on energy
performance in the housing sector, gaps in the literature have been found and need to
be filled. This study’s energy efficiency policy variables include standard energy policies
and codes, financial incentives, and information policies. Given that in most previous
studies only one or two of these policies have been used to examine the impact of energy
efficiency policies, extensive use of the number of policies to explore their effect is one of
the main innovations of this study. On the other hand, there is no research on the impact of
energy efficiency policies on energy performance in the household sector in Portugal. The
research that has been done so far, with the exclusion of Portugal, was mainly based on the
European Union, OECD, India, and China. The following section presents the data and
methods used in this research.

The study uses data from 2014 to 2021. Data availability for the variables was the main
criteria to establish the period used, for example, (i) the energy performance certificates (A+,
A, B, B−, C, D, E, and F). This investigation used only issued EPCs for new and existing
residences/houses. Moreover, the number of EPCs issued were constructed in accumulated
form for each Portuguese district until November 2021; and (ii) CSEPA, FFIPA, and IEPA,
the national-level policies in force. This investigation opted to use the policies at the
national level because the Portuguese districts do not have the autonomy to legislate or
create their own energy policies. Therefore, these variables were generated until November
2021. Indeed, each policy is represented by the sum over policies throughout its useful life
or end. Therefore, for the variables CCPC and IPCC (an estimation of GDP per capita, for
2020, was used), this investigation used data until 2020.

In Portugal, EPCs are used to summarise the energy efficiency of residential properties.
Furthermore, in Portugal, the residential properties are given a rating between A+ (Very
efficient) and F (Inefficient) (see Figure 7 below).

Moreover, in Portugal, the EPCs consider several aspects of a residential property to
classify the energy efficiency. For example, the EPCs take into account (i) the energy consumption characteristics of home appliances; (ii) hot water and measures to mitigate the
energy consumption; (iii) the property’s location; (iv) the floor and the area; (v) the year it
was built; and (vi) the configuration of its surroundings (i.e., roofs, walls, floors, and win-

Moreover, the variables CSEPA, FFIPA, and IEPA were generated as an accumulated
variable, where each new policy is the sum of the policies during its useful life or until its
end. This method was developed by Fuinhas et al. [61] and Koengkan et al. [62]. Finally,
the variables were transformed into natural logarithms to make them more symmetrical
and reduce their volatility and the influence of outliers.
After showing the variables used in our empirical investigation, we can demonstrate
the descriptive statistics (see Table 3 below). Natural logarithms were used to linearise the
relationships between the model variables [62]; also, Log denotes variables in the natural
logarithms, and the Stata command sum was used to perform the descriptive statistics.

This investigation used variable codes and standards, fiscal, and information policies.
According to Trotta et al. [28], the standards for buildings and energy-related products
ensure that the desired energy performance of the building components and (especially)
heating equipment is achieved even when its purchaser has been related to the existence of
credit and policies for support.
Indeed, according to Noailly [26], the energy efficiency policies show that, for example, the energy efficiency standards policies (codes and standards) have been one of the
main drives of innovation and energy efficiency in buildings and residential properties.
Moreover, Bleischwitz et al. [63] add that this type of policy is the preferred option in the
European Union to reduce the barriers to energy efficiency in residential properties. An
empirical proof that the energy efficiency policies increase the residential sector was found
by Broin et al. [30]. The authors used panel data of fourteen European Union countries to
estimate the efficiency standard policies’ impact on space heating demand in the residential
sector from 1990 to 2010. The authors pointed out that the efficiency standard policies are
more effective than the European Union’s fiscal/financial or informative policies. These
findings agree with earlier studies of Filippini et al. [27] and Saussay et al. [31].
Considering the fiscal/financial incentive policies, Trotta et al. [28] mentioned that fiscal incentive policies encouraging energy efficiency in residences include several measures
to lower the taxes paid by consumers. Indeed, the same authors add that these policies
are instruments that European countries can use to promote and facilitate efficient energy
use among domestic customers. For example, in European Union countries, this policy
covers (i) reducing the heating demand by overall upgrading of the building’s energy
performance; (ii) improving the building’s thermal insulation (replacement of windows,
including blinds and fittings, and insulation of roofs, walls, and floors); (iii) installing solar
thermal panels; (iv) replacing winter heating systems (with condensing boilers or heat
pumps); and (v) replacing electrical water heaters with heat pump water heaters. In the
literature, the evidence that policies such as fiscal and financial incentives can boost energy
efficiency was found by several authors (e.g., Broin et al. [30], Filippini et al. [27], and
Saussay et al. [31]).
Regarding the information policies, Trotta et al. [28] comment that the information and
educational policies induce a change in the consumer’s behaviour by providing information
about potential energy savings from energy-efficient products or investments and including
programmes to give feedback to consumers about their energy consumption. In the
literature, this variable was used by some authors, such as Trotta et al. [28], Broin et al. [30],
and Filippini et al. [27], to explain the effect of information and education policies on energy
efficiency. All these authors find a positive impact of information and education policies on
energy efficiency in European Union countries.

This investigation used the GDP per capita because the income increase allows the
households to invest in renovating buildings/residences and sustainable building/residence
construction, installing energy-efficient heating systems, and purchasing more energyefficient equipment. Moreover, in the literature, this variable was used by several authors
(e.g., Broin et al. [30], Filippini et al. [27], and Saussay et al. [31]) to explain the effect of
income on energy efficiency. Indeed, all these authors find a positive impact of income on
energy efficiency in European Union countries.
Finally, this empirical investigation used credit variables (consumer and house credit).
As Trotta et al. [28] mentioned, soft loans are commonly used to encourage energy efficiency improvements by lowering the inhibitive upfront costs faced by households. In
Portugal, families commonly use two types of credit (consumer and home credit) to renovate buildings/residences and for sustainable building/residence construction, installing
energy-efficient heating systems, and purchasing more energy-efficient equipment. Some
authors have investigated the effect of credit or capital on energy efficiency. For example,
Zhang et al. [64] studied the impact of credit access on energy intensity (a proxy of energy
efficiency) for China between 2011 to 2013. The empirical results indicate that the firms
with access to credit are associated with lower energy efficiency. In other words, firms with
credit access tend to have significantly higher energy use per unit of output. Koengkan [65]
investigated the effect of capital stock development on renewable energy investment in
Latin America and the Caribbean region between 1990 and 2016. The author found that
increasing public credit reduces the financing costs and encourages the development and
investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.
3.2. Method
In this section, we present the estimation method and the pre- and post-estimation
tests made to assess the quality of the econometric model. To assess the impact of the
previously described covariates on the number of issued EPCs, the next panel estimation
was estimated for each energy performance certificate scale.

LogEPCki,t = αk + βk Xt + cik + ui,t

where LogEPCki,t is the natural logarithm of the cumulative number of issued energy
performance certificates scale, k (k = A+, A, B, C, D, E, and F), for district i in the year

k are the districtregression k and βk are the explanatory variables’ coefficients; and cik and ui,t
specific random effect for district i in the regression k and the individual-specific random
effect for equation k, respectively.
Before estimating Equation (1), it is essential to perform several preliminary tests to
assess the data’s statistical properties and identify the adequate estimation method. Thus,
we conducted the following tests:
(i)

Skewness/kurtosis test for normality (D’Agostino [66])—the null hypothesis states
that data is normally distributed. By combining skewness and kurtosis, this test has
higher power to test for normality.
(ii) Shapiro–Wilk test for normality (Shapiro and Wilk [67])—the null hypothesis states
that the data is normally distributed. Moreover, this test is based on the first two
moments of the order statistics.
(iii) Variance inflation factor (VIF)—a high value for the VIF suggests that the variables
are highly correlated, which leads to imprecise and unstable coefficient estimates.
(iv) Levin–Lin–Chu (LLC) panel unit root test (Levin et al., [68])—the null hypothesis is
that the variables are non-stationary. Moreover, stationarity in the models is necessary
to prevent estimating a spurious regression [62].
(v) Hausman test (Hausman [69])—this test is built on comparing random effects (RE)
and fixed-effects (FE) estimates. The test has the null hypothesis of consistency of

Energies 2022, 15, 802

15 of 24

the random effects estimator. Moreover, in this test, the null hypothesis fails once the
unobserved effect is correlated with the covariates. In this situation, a fixed-effects
estimator is preferable [62].
The residuals’ statistical properties were tested after estimating Equation (1). Thus,
the non-appearance of some characteristics, such as heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation,
and cross-sectional independence, were tested. When one of these violations occurred, it
biased the estimated standard errors. In this case, it is advised to use an estimator that can
compute robust standard errors [62].
(i)

Wooldridge’s autocorrelation test (Wooldridge [70])—the test examines if the idiosyncratic estimation residuals are correlated. The test has the null hypothesis of no
autocorrelation.
(ii) Breusch–Pagan’s heteroscedasticity test (Breusch and Pagan [71])—the test has the
null hypothesis that the idiosyncratic errors are homoscedastic [62].
(iii) Cross-sectional dependence test (Pesaran [72])—the null hypothesis presupposes
that the idiosyncratic residuals are cross-sectionally uncorrelated. The alternative
hypothesis assumes that residuals could be correlated across units [62].
The following section reveals the empirical findings of this research.
4. Empirical Results
As mentioned before, this section will focus on the empirical results of our investigation. In other words, the preliminary tests, main model regression, post estimation tests,
and robustness check. The first step before the model regression is the realisation of the
preliminary tests, such as (i) the normal distribution tests (e.g., skewness/kurtosis test and
Shapiro-Wilk test); (ii) VIF test; (iii) Unit root test; and (iv) Hausman test.
Therefore, to test the presence of normality in the variables, the normality of distribution was tested with the skewness/kurtosis test—first separately and then combined, and
with the Shapiro–Wilk test (see Table 4 below). The Stata commands sktest and swilk were
used to perform the normal distribution tests.

Table 4 above shows that the data is slightly positively skewed (1 > 0) and with a
lighter tail (β2 < 3); that is, in the direction of a higher-rated housing certificate or more
policies and with fewer extreme values. For LogA and LogCCPC, the distributions of
the scores were more highly skewed. The D’Agostino et al. [66] skewness/kurtosis test
allows us to reject the null hypothesis of a normal distribution of the data. Furthermore,
when testing normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test, the returned values suggest the null

Energies 2022, 15, 802

of normal distribution for LogA+, LogB−, LogC, LogD, LogE, LogFFIPA, and LogCCPC
can be rejected; the other variables are normally distributed in the model. Therefore, the
data are not normally distributed in the model. After realising the normality distribution
tests, it was necessary to assess multicollinearity between the model’s variables. To this end,
the variance inflation factor (VIF) test was realised (see Table 5 below). The Stata command
vif was used to perform the VIF test.

The results from Table 5 point that the variance inflation factor is in the range of 1.0 to
10, signifying a relatively high but tolerable collinearity among the predictor variables in
the regression [63]. The repeated VIF value shows that the income and policy variables
are repeated for each cross, as the policies are determined at the national level. After
identifying high multicollinearity between the variables, it was time to identify the unit
roots. The first-generation LLC panel unit root was computed to achieve this objective (see
Table 6 below). The Stata command xtunitroot llc was used to perform the unit root test.

In Table 6, the first-generation test for the unit roots developed by Levin, Lin, and
Chu [59] is displayed. They show that most panels are stationary; that is, I(0). In turn, some
panels (LogFFIPA, LogIPCC, and LogCCPC) are near-stationary; that is, on the boundary
between the I(0) and I (1) order of integration. The stationarity of the variables is due to
low temporal variation in the variables, leading to random effects. Therefore, the next step
of this investigation is to search for individual effects. To this end, the Hausman test, which
compares the random (RE) and fixed effects (FE), was computed (see Table 7 below). The
Stata command hausman was used to perform the Hausman test.

According to Koengkan et al. [62], when the data fails to meet the asymptotic assumptions of the Hausman test, the results of the Hausman test contrast with the use of the RE
or FE models (see Table 7); it can be concluded that the RE model is present. According to
the same authors, when this occurs, it is an indication of the non-systematic difference in
coefficients.
The second step after the preliminary tests is the realisation of the random-effects
linear regression model. Table 8 below show the outcomes of the linear RE model. The Stata
command xtreg with the option re robust was used to perform the linear random-effects
model regressions.

The random-effects linear regression analysis (see Table 8 above) shows that most
policies have a significant, differentiated effect on residential energy efficiency choice. For
example, the variable LogIPCC impacts negatively the residential properties with higher
energy efficiency; that is, with high energy efficiency performance certificates (e.g., A+, A,
and B). It supports that Portuguese personal income is low and prevents the investment in
residential properties with high energy efficiency, making consumers prone to prefer the
least expensive, lower-efficiency residential properties; that is, with low energy efficiency
performance certificates (e.g., C, D, and E).

Energies 2022, 15, 802

18 of 24

Regarding the energy policy effect on the choice of energy efficiency of the residential
properties, results are not uniform. Consumer credit (LogCCPC) positively impact higherefficiency residential property and negatively impact lower-grade certificates. Consumers
may decide to use credit for higher-efficiency housing when facing a budget constraint.
For fiscal policies (LogFFIPA), the impact is also positive for the higher-grade certified residential property (e.g., A+, A, B, and B−) and negative for the lower-efficiency residential
property (e.g., C and D). Taken together, this may suggest that consumers are encouraged to
take on credit because of fiscal policies—a tax reduction in the interest rates—for purchases
of higher-efficiency housing. These differentiating effects of personal income, credit, and
fiscal policies on residential energy efficiency suggest that incentives are narrowly targeted
to higher energy-efficient homes. Indeed, they effectively incentivise higher-efficiency housing purchases, thus leading to greater differentiation in the residential sector concerning
energy efficiency.
It should be noted that the effects of consumer credit and fiscal policies in the F
category do not follow the general tendency described above. Regarding income per
capita, the negative impact shows that consumers tend to not choose the lowest-efficiency
residential property as income rises. However, fiscal and credit policies have positive
effects, suggesting that consumers use credit with comparatively higher interest rates.
Codes and standards policies (LogCSEPA) are significant and positive for higher-grade
efficiency residential property (e.g., A, B, B−, and C). They are negative for lower-efficiency
housing (e.g., D, E, and F) but insignificant for A+ housing, suggesting that these policies
cannot incentivise the choice for the highest-efficiency residential property. Information
and education policies (LogIEPA) positively affect most energy efficiency category housing,
with the greatest impact on higher-grade housing (e.g., A+, A, and B). The exception for
grade B− housing, for which information policies and personal income are insignificant,
may signify consumers choose average energy efficiency residential property without
policy incentives.
After the linear random-effects model regression, it was required to realise the postestimation tests; that is, in this investigation, the following tests will be computed:
(i) Wooldridge’s test; (ii) Breusch and Pagan LM test; and (iii) Pesaran’s test. Table 9
below points to the results of the post-estimation tests. The Stata commands xtserial,
xttest0, xtcsd, and pesaran abs were used to perform the post-estimation tests for the linear
random-effects of the models.

Table 9 reveals several diagnostic tests. The Breusch and Pagan LM test [71] rejects
homoscedasticity, supporting that the random-effects model is preferable compared to the
OLS one. Woolridge’s [70] test found diverse results for panel autocorrelation. Autocorrelation was found in the energy efficiency certificates for the grades A+, A, B, B− and D, but
not in certificate grades C, E, and F. Pesaran’s [72] test for residuals reveals cross-sectional
dependence for the energy EPC of grades B−, C, E, and F. In contrast, the energy EPC of
A, B, and D shows cross-sectional independence.
Figure 8 below reviews the independent variables’ impact on the dependent ones.
Therefore, this figure was created with the results from Table 8 above.

All these factors may lead to an enhanced awareness of the owners on the advantages
of increased building energy efficiency, leading them to take the necessary measures to
turn their properties into high-grade housings (A+, A, and B). Indeed, following the data
from the Portuguese Energy Agency (ADENE), in 2014, only 1828 certificates for residential
houses were A+, 6135 were A, and 9337 were B, which contrasts with 2021, where 3370 of
the issued certificates were A+, 12,472 were A, and 10,050 were B [59].
According to “The Energy Efficiency Watch Survey Report 2020” [74], Portugal’s
progress in energy efficiency policies has been significant. Experts recognise the valuable
progress made in promoting energy efficiency in this report. Indeed, in industry, transport, and buildings, with energy labelling of products, energy efficiency requirements for
buildings, and energy certification of buildings being pointed as the most effective specific
policy measures.
However, the models’ results reveal strong restraints limiting the Portuguese investment in highly energy-efficient housing. Indeed, Portugal has a household income that
can be considered low [75]. Therefore, the policy has been used to lessen the budget
constraints of Portuguese households. Indeed, to support energy efficiency projects, the
execution of fiscal and financial incentive policies (LogFFIPA) is of major relevance. “The
Energy Efficiency Watch Survey Report 2020” [74] already referred to the ineffectiveness of
Portuguese policies.
Furthermore, many experts (46%) consider financial incentives ineffective [62] in
promoting investments energetically efficient. Consequently, it is far from unexpected that
the effect of consumer credit (LogCCPC) is of higher magnitude than the one from fiscal
and financial incentive policies (LogFFIPA). Therefore, one can consider that, in the absence
of appropriate fiscal and financial incentives, households will recur to credit to materialise
their projects to achieve energy efficiency in their houses.
Nevertheless, the Portuguese government seems to recognise that failure. To deal with
the goals of “Plano Nacional Energia e Clima 2030” (National Energy and Climate Plan
2030), the “Programa de Apoio Edifícios mais Sustentáveis” (More Sustainable Buildings
Support Program) was created by the Portuguese government. It was assigned 4.5 million
euros in 2020/2021 to implement the first phase. This first phase intended to establish
procedures and actions to boost (i) rehabilitation; (ii) decarbonisation; (iii) energy efficiency;
(iv) water efficiency; and (v) buildings’ circular economy. Indeed, the initial endowment
of 4.5 million euros was soon exhausted, requiring the addition of 5 million euros. Furthermore, the Portuguese government publicised the program’s second phase, “Plano de
Recuperação e Resiliência” (Recovery and Resilience Plan), in the summer of 2021. This
phase incentivises projects to improve the energy sustainability of houses. Consequently,
the government is supporting this investment with a further 30 million euros.
6. Conclusions and Policy Implications
This article addressed the impact of energy efficiency policies on EPCs for residential
properties, identifying whether energy policies effectively promote the residential properties’ energy efficiency in Portugal. It is essential to highlight that the characteristics of
buildings are fundamental in determining the energy needs and identifying possible ways
to enhance energy efficiency.
The increase in energy consumption is a consequence of the development of societies.
However, this increase can be significantly reduced through responsible use of energy. The
residential sector is one of the biggest energy consumers in Portugal. Energy consumption
in habitations depends on several factors, such as construction quality, location, insulation
level, and equipment types.
Buildings are responsible for considerable environmental impacts throughout their
life cycle, as they cause the occupation and use of land and changes in local ecosystems.
When applied to residential buildings, energy certification allows future owners to know
the energy performance of habitation even before its purchase and use. In this way, the

Energies 2022, 15, 802

21 of 24

importance of builders using more efficient construction solutions and equipment, from an
energy point of view, is highlighted.
Energy inefficiency is caused by excessive energy consumption in the habitations.
Several factors contribute to excessive consumption, such as thermal comfort, the number
of equipment used and its energy efficiency, the local climatic conditions, and the economic
conditions of the families.
The findings of this article can support policymakers in choosing measures with the
most significant potential for implementation in the housing sector and which may be the
target of public and private support and financing for the improvement and development of
Portugal’s housing park. It is important to promote sustainable energy consumption based
on renewable energy sources, adopting public policies to promote energy efficiency together
with environmentally conscious decisions. Thus, it is necessary to implement changes in
the design phase of buildings and their use phase, studying their energy performance and
improvement strategies to realise sustainable construction.
Portugal is taking several measures to make its economy more efficient and sustainable, following the guidelines of European policies regarding the energy performance
of residential housing. Among the measures are (i) to support and promote policies to
encourage energy efficiency and the rehabilitation of energy-efficient residential buildings;
(ii) encourage the promotion of smart technologies; (iii) decrease energy consumption;
(iv) reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas; (v) increase energy efficiency with the use of
renewable energy sources; (vi) reduce energy consumption needs and energy dependence;
and (vii) promote financial mechanisms and incentives to encourage the construction of
energy-efficient real estate parks.
Energy efficiency policies for residential properties in Portugal contribute to sustainable growth and an efficient economy in terms of resources and reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, the public sector can create new markets for energy-efficient
technologies, services, and business models. On the economic front, it is necessary to
optimise investments in promoting energy efficiency in the housing sector. Increased public
sector credit and subsidy policies reduce the financing costs, encouraging development
and investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency. In addition, it is
necessary to develop strategic planning to direct resources and investments, thereby establishing policies and goals to promote energy efficiency. On the social front, it is essential to
learn to use energy responsibly and raise awareness among users to improve the present
and ensure a better future for future generations.
Furthermore, it is crucial to adopt the best practices and small actions to save energy.
On the environmental front, it is recommended to apply renewable energy to construct
and improve residential properties, such as photovoltaic solar panels. Therefore, it is
crucial to supply the maximum energy from renewable energies to prevent and mitigate
environmental impacts from energy production. The application of renewable energies is
essential for increasing energy efficiency and ensuring sustainability.
Finally, the finds of this investigation may lead us to develop future investigations,
such as the effect of energy efficiency certificates on transaction prices and rents. As we
already know, the environmental and energy labelling schemes make visible in the market a
dimension of a product that is not easily visible, in this case, energy performance. Therefore,
in the absence of information from sellers regarding the energy performance of a property,
the added value of a well-insulated building would not be reflected in the transaction
price or rent. It may, in turn, dissuade owners from making energy-saving improvements—
especially if they are planning to rent their property or sell it in the short term. Therefore, it
is essential to understand how these energy certificates affect the transaction prices and
rents in Portugal to develop public policies that mitigate possible imbalances in the housing
market and increase the access to residential properties with high energy efficiency by
low-income families.
