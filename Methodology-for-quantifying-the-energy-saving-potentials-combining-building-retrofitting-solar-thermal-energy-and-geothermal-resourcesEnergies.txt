Abstract: New technological, societal and legislative developments are necessary to support transitions
to low-carbon energy systems. The building sector is responsible for almost 36% of the global final
energy and 40% of CO2 emissions, so this sector has high potential to contribute to the expansion
of positive energy districts. With this aim, a new digital Geographic Information System (GIS)
platform has been developed to quantify the energy savings obtained through the implementation of
refurbishment measures in residential buildings, including solar thermal collectors and geothermal
technologies and assuming the postal district as the representative unit for the territory. Solar
resources have been estimated from recently updated solar irradiation maps, whereas geothermal
resources have been estimated from geological maps. Urbanistic data have been estimated from
official cadastre databases. For representative buildings, the annual energy demand and savings are
obtained and compared with reference buildings, both for heating and cooling. The GIS platform
provides information on average results for each postal district, as well as estimates for buildings
with particular parameters. The methodology has been applied to the Asturian region, an area of
about 10,600 km2 on the Cantabrian coast of Spain, with complex orography and scattered population,
qualified as a region in energy transition. High rehabilitation potentials have been achieved for
buildings constructed before the implementation of the Spanish Technical Building Code of 2006,
being higher for isolated houses than for collective buildings. Some examples of results are introduced
in specific localities of different climatic zones.

1. Introduction
The energy transformation towards a more efficient and less polluting system represents a global
problem that must be addressed by all sectors of society. National, regional and local governments
must work together involving all the stakeholders, public and private. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted in its 2018 report [1] the strong impact produced by global
Energies 2020, 13, 5970; doi:10.3390/en13225970

warming and called for urgent actions. To reduce the high contribution of energy sector on greenhouse
gas emissions (two thirds of the total), the IPCC has promoted an immediate increase in renewable
energy use and energy efficiency.
The goal of achieving massive decarbonisation and reducing the rise in global temperatures to
well below 2 ◦ C [2] can be achieved safely, reliably and affordably by using sustainable technologies.
The analysis develops by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) [3] shows that the
combination of renewable technologies, energy efficiency and increased electrification could achieve
90% of the necessary reductions in energy-related emissions.
The generation of renewable energy depends on meteorological variables such as temperature,
irradiation, precipitation or wind [4], being strongly influenced by the climatic trends of the coming
years. The effects of climate change will have implications on the reliability and performance of the
energy system [5,6]. This can affect the lifespan of energy infrastructure [7] and other factors within
the value chain of the energy sector [8,9].
Due to the rapid population growth in cities and global climate change, energy consumption
in buildings has increased in recent decades [10]. Cities in developed countries are thought to be
the main worldwide energy consumers and the main source of pithy greenhouse gas emissions [11].
To tackle climate change [12] and fast urbanisation, challenges, adaptation and mitigation measures are
required and play an important role in the essential transformation of urban areas. Energy potential,
usage and capacity at district scale have turned into important factors to understand energy flows
at this scale [13]. This knowledge can help to reduce most effectively the energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector [14]. Different urban models, methods and tools [15]
help policymakers, governors and other stakeholders in urban design and planning, and promoting
nearly zero energy buildings [16], but also in the cost-effective renovation of building stock. At the
district level, urban energy use [17] has gained a prominent relevance in building refurbishment, being
usually addressed by centralised interventions taking building synergies into consideration [18].
Multiple Geographic Information System (GIS) studies are related to urban energy analyses.
Terés-Zubiaga et al. [19] developed a GIS-based methodology to identify optimal solutions at district
scale, with balanced renewable energy supply and energy efficiency measures. The energy consumption
and the renewable energy potential have also been assessed by Santoli et al. [20] at municipality scale.
Other authors [21] evaluated affordable and sustainable urban electricity supply systems in cities,
which have also been modelled and optimized in open source GIS platforms. Building Information
Modelling (BIM) and GIS can be integrated in building environments to tackle multiple aspects such
as urban governance, building energy management or construction projects [22]. A study developed
by Marzouk et al. on this topic assessed the infrastructure requirements associated with the water
consumption, the sewage capacity and the electrical supply for expanding cities [23]. Other authors
integrated GIS into urban sustainability assessment systems, helping local governments to define
land-use policies [24]. Krietemeyer et al. developed an interactive platform for spatiotemporal
visualization of simulated building energy consumption to support climate adaptation strategies in
variable energy scenarios [25].
In addition, energy consumption of the building stock has been assessed at the urban scale,
identifying homogenous energy areas [26,27]. GIS technology has been applied in combination
with statistical analysis to identify the variables that influence building energy consumption [28].
In addition, the effects of urban form [29] or climate change [30] on building demands have been
evaluated. Praene et al. defined accurate climate zones to evaluate the thermal performance [31].
Garcia-Ballano et al. calculated energy savings in rehabilitated buildings after the improvement of the
exterior building envelope [32]. In addition, the GIS techniques have been combined with multi-criteria
decision-making tools to set up plus-energy buildings [33], and machine-learning technology has been
combined with GIS to evaluate retrofit potential in buildings [34]. Finally, other studies evaluated the
available renewable resources in the study area. Sarmiento et al. proposed a GIS model based on
the use of satellite data to determine solar irradiation resources in a specific region of Argentina [35].

Energies 2020, 13, 5970

The energy potential of the biomass obtained from the urban greenery maintenance has been evaluated
and has been considered as a low-range renewable resource [36]. More recently, a new GIS model has
been developed to face heat waves by using pavement watering for urban cooling [37].
Moreover, these techniques have been used to obtain information about the boundary conditions
of the urban environment. For example, Viana-Fonts et al. developed shadow cast profiles of buildings
in urban areas from cadastral cartography and LiDAR altimetric data [38]. Liang et al. developed an
interactive GIS tool for sky, tree and building view factor estimation from street view photographs [39].
To summarize, according to previous studies, the flexibility of GIS tools enables the performance
of a wide variety of urban analysis.
In this context, this paper presents a new geographic information system platform developed to
spatially analyse relevant urban features, such as building density and type, geothermal resources
and solar potential production. Furthermore, potential energy savings on the existing building stock,
considering all these factors, have been calculated. This platform relies upon GIS technology, is an initial
approach to urban energy analysis and contributes to the reinforcement of European energy and climate
policies oriented to a fundamental transformation of the energy system. Proposed cost-effective actions
improve energy efficiency, promote centralised solutions based on low-carbon energy innovations
and boost technologies to mitigate global warming. An initial case study has been applied to the
Principality of Asturias, a region of more than 10,000 km2 on the northern coast of Spain, with complex
orography and scattered population. This region is characterized by a temperate climate based on
the Köppen Geiger classification, with mild temperatures registered in both winter and summer and
abundant rainfall throughout the year. There are different climate zones depending on the precipitation
patterns, ranging from oceanic (Cfb) to Mediterranean oceanic (Csb). These climatic conditions lead to
high heating loads and low cooling loads. These actions, in terms of reducing the carbon cycle for
ongoing energy transition processes, guarantee a sustainable socio-economic development of the area,
and incentivise a municipality scale approach to the implementation of renewable energies through
efficient district systems.
2. Materials and Methods
To cope with the increase in the energy consumption in buildings, several projects have been
developed during recent decades with the aim of helping users, local administrations and stakeholders
to make the better decisions to improve and optimize the energy efficiency of the building stock [40].
In this line, the Spanish research project RehabilitaGeoSol (RGS) [41] has developed a
citizen-oriented platform (RGS platform) that suggests to the parties involved the energy savings
obtained through the implementation of retrofit interventions, solar thermal panels and geothermal
technologies in residential buildings.
A building expert should choose between several retrofitting actions, reconciling energy,
environmental, legal and social factors to achieve a good compromise solution that meets the final needs
of occupants. The search for a reasonable solution can be carried out through an energy analysis of the
building and through the development of various situations predefined by a building-physics expert,
mainly through simulations [42]. In addition, a second approach which incorporates decision aid
techniques such as multi-criteria analysis [43], multi-objective optimization [44], generally combined
with simulations to help reach a final decision [45], can be considered.
The methodology used to create the retrofit databases of the RGS project has been applied to
the Principality of Asturias. Up to 800 postal districts have been analysed, showing the interest of
combining building retrofitting with solar and geothermal strategies.
Annual and seasonal thermal loads for each refurbishment option proposed have been calculated
in order to provide the input data to the platform. The final outputs are the energy-savings reached
by the implementation of retrofit measures, solar thermal panels and geothermal technologies in
residential buildings.

Opaque elements (roof, walls, ground) and transparent elements (glass and frames) have been
defined for each climate zone and each normative value. The glass elements are characterized by the
heat transfer coefficient (Ulimit ) and the solar heat gain coefficient (g).
In order to complete the building models, occupancy, lighting, equipment and air renovations
gains are defined using the Spanish tools for the Energy Certification of Buildings as the reference
database [64].
Two periods of thermal conditioning are established, summer (June–September) and winter
(October–May), each one with its respective temperature set point. Two types of annual air renovation
are modelled: infiltration and ventilation. The infiltration values are defined constant, depending on
the type of house and the year of construction:
•
•

Regulations before 2008: 0.8 ren/h.
Regulations after 2008:
#
#

Single-family house: 0.3 ren/h.
Blocks of houses: 0.24 ren/h.

The ventilation rates depend on the occupation:

•
•

No occupancy: 0.2 ren/h.
Occupancy: 1.2 ren/h.

2.4.2. Phase 2: Development of a Dynamic Simulation Environment
A dynamic simulation environment has been developed to calculate the energy demands of the
building cases. This environment consists on the coupling between the dynamic simulation program
TRNSYS [65] and the parameterization program GenOpt [66]. The combination of these programs
automates the execution of the simulation batteries; generating successive building models for each
studied option. TRNSYS has been used as the engine of the simulation environment. GenOpt identifies
the studied variables of the building cases and runs a series of simulations, modifying only one of

Energies 2020, 13, 5970

9 of 25

them. The outputs provided by this environment are heating, cooling and annual loads and have been
used to feed the building analysis tools of the online platform.
A multi-parametric analysis has been done by modifying some studied variables of the eight
representative building cases.
•

•
•
•
•

Climate zones: C1, D1 and E1.
Year of construction: before 1979, 1979–2008, 2008–2013 and after 2014.
Type of window: before 1979, 1979–2008, 2008–2013 and after 2014.
Number of plants for blocks: 4, 7 and 10.
Surface area for blocks: 200, 400 and 800 m2 .
Percentage of shading received on windows for the main façades during summer: 0, 25, 50, 75
and 100%.

2.4.3. Phase 3: Post-Processing and Creation of the Building Analysis Matrices
A post-processing evaluation of the output variables provided by the simulation batteries has
been done with the program Matlab to create the databases that feed the online building modules.
Heating, cooling and annual loads have been assessed to calculate the retrofitting potentials reached
by each building configuration. These potentials are calculated with respect to the minimum value of
the annual thermal demand, which corresponds to the normative values after 2014.
Two different analysis building modules have been developed. The first module provides the
maximum retrofitting potential reached in each postal district of the Principality of Asturias. The second
module provides a customized retrofitting potential for each building configuration defined by the
user. Once the two databases have been created, they are represented in the GIS-based web application
viewer through the Rehabilitation Potential tabs.
2.5. Solar Savings
The expected energy savings caused by a domestic solar water heating (SWH) system have been
estimated by means of the f-Chart method [67], considering that each single house or flat is provided
with a 2 m2 flat solar collector tilted 25◦ towards the South. The behaviour of the collector has been
modelled assuming a typical performance in accordance with the following characteristic line:
η = 0.78 − 4

Te − Tamb
,
Ig

(1)

where η is the collector efficiency, Te is the fluid temperature at the inlet of the collector, Tamb is the
ambient temperature and I g is the global solar irradiance on the collector surface.
To calculate the demand in each home, a daily consumption of 120 L of domestic hot water at
◦
60 C has been considered.
The cold water temperature of the supply network is corrected for each postal district based on
the altitude difference with the province capital, as proposed by the Spanish Technical Building Code:
Tr = TrC − 0.005(A − AC ),

(2)

where Tr is the water temperature in the supply network of the postal district, TrC is the water
temperature in the supply network of the province capital, A is the average altitude of the postal
district and AC is the altitude of the province capital.
For the climatic variables, the annual average values of irradiation and air temperatures in the
postal district have been used. The annual averages of irradiation on inclined collectors are calculated
from the values on a horizontal surface using the following approximation, which is justified by series
of measurements at the Oviedo- State Meteorological Agency of Spain (AEMET) meteorological station:

Energies 2020, 13, 5970

10 of 25

G(0, 25◦ ) ≈ 1.2G(0).

(3)

where G(0, 25◦ ) is the global solar irradiation on a surface tilted 25◦ towards the South, and G(0) is the
value on a horizontal surface.
The mass flow rate of 0.028 kg/s is assumed for the fluid circulating through the collector, while
the installation is completed with an accumulator with a capacity of 150 litres and an internal heat
exchanger with an efficiency of 90%.
2.6. Geothermal Savings
The geological data under Section 2.1 are used to estimate the savings derived from the geothermal
resource, for a 100 m2 rehabilitated single-family building, based on the building typologies and the
following input variables:
•
•
•
•

Building construction year.
Floor surface area.
Current fuel.
Age of the current heating equipment.

The length of the required geothermal ground-heat exchanger is calculated as a previous step to
perform a study of energy savings, CO2 emissions and economic advantages compared to the current
heating system, by means of the Equation (4) [49]:
L=

Q· COP−1
COP ·(RP + RS ·F)

(4)

TL − TMIN

where L is the length of the vertical exchanger, Q is the heating power of the building, COP is the
equipment efficiency (Coefficient Of Performance), RP is the thermal resistance per unit length of the
buried exchanger pipe, RS is the thermal resistance per unit length of the ground, F is the utilization
factor, TL is the ground temperature and TMIN is the minimum temperature.
The energy demand per surface unit of each building has been calculated keeping in mind the
envelope thermal characteristics and the building typology, supported by data from the project itself.
The proposed system, based on heat pump technology, is powered by geothermal energy and auxiliary
electrical energy. Assuming a typical heat pump COP of 4.9, necessary electrical energy and free
geothermal energy obtained from the subsoil are calculated for each building.
Geothermal systems are compared with conventional natural gas or gas oil systems in terms of
CO2 emissions. It takes the different performances into account according to the age of the current
heating equipment and CO2 emissions factors [68] (Table 4). For the final emissions calculation,
these factors are multiplied by the energy consumed.
Table 4. CO2 Emissions factors by power source.

The geothermal system is also compared in terms of energy costs. It considers the average cost in
EUR per kWh of electricity [69], gas oil [70] and natural gas [69], which is also multiplied by the energy
consumed (Table 4).
In this way, the results of energy, emissions and cost savings are achieved for different buildings
under input parameters.

3. Results
A digital platform has been developed to collect all the results obtained in relation to the different
energy resources studied as well as to the multi-parametric analysis of the energy performance of
buildings. The main purpose of this platform is to provide end-users with the results of the energy
savings assembled potential according to the interaction of the different technologies and available
energy resources. This platform has been built upon GIS technologies and it is composed of two core
modules which have been designed taking user-friendly requirements and an interactive visualization
into account. The first module is the viewer, which is intended to provide information about the
maximum potential of the energy savings achieved for building renovation in the Principality of
Asturias. On the other hand, the second module of the platform makes it possible to obtain a
rehabilitation potential for each customized building model evaluated. In this module, users can
modify the input building conditions, adjusting them to their particular characteristics. The input
variables that can be modified in a personalized way are: local climate zone, type of building, year of
construction, number of floors, floor area, type of windows and percentage of summer shading on the
north, south, east and west façade individually. The outputs values provided by this second module
are the percentage of annual heating, cooling and total retrofitting potentials.
Figure 5 shows the main screen of the viewer module that is seen when entering the platform.
Two different spaces can be visualized: a map on the right side and a space reserved for a Layer Tree
on the left one. The information is shown depicted on a map of the Principality of Asturias, which is
divided into postal districts. To plot the information, an enabling/disabling system is used, which can
be found in the Layer Tree. When any of these layers is enabled, the associated information is depicted
according to a colour scale, affecting every single postal district separately. Additional information can
be obtained
when the cursor is hovered over each of them.

Potential savings in domestic SWH consumption have been computed according to Section 2.5 for
every postal district and represented in Figure 6. Under the assumed conditions, solar savings over
30%, which is the minimum required by the Spanish regulation for a single family house, are observed
for most of the region. The software also provides the possibility of varying the number and type of
collectors, as well as considering factors of loss due to orientation, tilt and shading.

Keeping all other variables equal, in the postal district 33817 in Cangas del Narcea (Figure 9),
103 drilling meters are needed while in the postal district 33815, 140 m are needed. As both postal
districts are in the same location, there is an increase of 35.92% affecting the cost of geothermal drilling.
The larger the floor area, the more substantial the differences will be in the same locations.
The year of construction also affects geothermal sizing, as the building demand is different.
In a building with a 100 m2 floor plant placed in the postal district 33191 of Oviedo (Figure 8),
other parameters being equal, 140 drilling meters are needed in the year of construction 1800–1979
whereas in the year of construction 2014–2016 only 97 m are needed. It is clear that building regulations
have made it possible to reduce the rates of thermal demand. In this case, this is 44.33% more favourable,

The implementation of the geothermal system in cases 1 and 2 would avoid the emission of about
75% of CO2 emissions, while in case 3 it is almost 84%. These data make the geothermal heating
system a renewable system with special environmental interest, more accentuated in large and old
buildings. In economic terms, cases 1 and 2 mean a saving of between EUR 1000 and 1500. In the case
of buildings with old systems and high energy consumption, there are greater savings. In the case 3,
there is about EUR 12,000 in annual savings compared to the previous gas oil system. Profitability
analysis can be carried out, comparing drilling and heat pump systems versus the conventional system.
In this case, with a 12 kW heat pump, it is estimated that the return on investment period is 6–7 years
with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of around 17–18%. From an economic point of view, geothermal
energy provides greater profitability than solar thermal energy, because the energy demand for SWH
applications is relatively low in residential buildings, even meeting the requirements of regulations to
reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
3.3. Retrofitting Potential
The mild climatic conditions registered in all regions of the Principality of Asturias have led to
high percentages of heating demands in comparison with the cooling demands throughout the year.
The annual heat contribution ranges, both for single-family houses and for blocks, between 71 and 93%
for isolated configurations and between 83 and 95% for semi-detached configurations. The range of
variability is due to climate conditions and the year of construction of the building. Figure 13 shows
the heating load contribution to the annual total loads reached by the eight representative building
cases (Cs1–Cs8) for the climate zones C1, D1 and E1 and for the four Spanish construction regulations.
In this figure, the floor area considered for blocks is 400 m2 .
The heating load contributions are higher for normative regulations before 2008 and lower for
normative regulations after 2008, with different percentages depending on the climate zone.
•

For Spanish construction regulations before 2008 (red and orange lines):
Zone C1: 88 to 93%.
Zone D1: 90 to 94%.
Zone E1: 91 to 95%.

•

#
#
#
#
#
#

Zone C1: 71 to 88%.
Zone D1: 74 to 90%.
Zone E1: 77 to 91%.

For Spanish construction regulations after 2008 (green and blue lines):

These percentages are obtained for single-family houses with 100 m2 of floor area and blocks with
400 m2 of floor area. In the case of blocks, the heating contributions to the annual thermal loads with
floor areas of 200 m2 are slightly lower while the heating contributions are slightly higher for floor
areas of 800 m2 .

In these three cities, the highest retrofitting potentials are achieved when there is no summer
shading over the windows of the external façades, decreasing as the percentage of shading increases.
Higher retrofitting potentials are obtained for single-family houses in comparison with fourstorey blocks, especially when the construction requirements are softer (before 2008). In both types
of houses, higher potentials are achieved for isolated configurations, being more remarkable for

For isolated configurations, the deviation between the climate zones is very similar, being slightly
higher when comparing Gijon and Oviedo. For semi-detached configurations, two tendencies have
been obtained. If the construction requirements are softer (regulations before 2008), higher deviations
are reached when comparing Oviedo and Cangas del Narcea. If the building energy requirements
are stricter (regulations after 2008), slightly higher deviations are obtained when comparing Gijon
and Oviedo.
As it can be seen in these figures, the annual retrofitting potentials reached in the three
municipalities are quite similar.
In these three cities, the highest retrofitting potentials are achieved when there is no summer
shading over the windows of the external façades, decreasing as the percentage of shading increases.
Higher retrofitting potentials are obtained for single-family houses in comparison with four-storey
blocks, especially when the construction requirements are softer (before 2008). In both types of houses,
higher potentials are achieved for isolated configurations, being more remarkable for construction
regulations before 2008.
4. Discussion and Conclusions
One of the results obtained in the RehabilitaGeoSol project is the creation of a GIS platform
developed to quantify the energy-savings obtained through the implementation of retrofit measures,
solar thermal panels and geothermal technologies in residential buildings placed in the Principality of
Asturias. This platform is composed of two different modules. Module 1 calculates, for each district of
Asturias, the maximum energy-saving potential. Module 2 makes it possible to obtain a personalized
potential based on the input characteristic of the platform.
The new developed GIS platform based on the interaction of different technologies and available
resources is a step forward in the field of built environment towards smart energy communities,
supporting the low carbon energy transition. The obtained results point to great energy mitigation
potential, justifying the need for public authorities to develop policies aimed at reducing the energy
demand of buildings, especially the heating loads. The generated maps could be helpful for retrofitting
considerations for existing housing stock in the Principality of Asturias, a key action that is completed
in combination with the use of solar thermal energy and geothermal resources towards sustainable
development. These policies are aligned with current construction trends of reducing the energy use
during the lifecycle of buildings and the promotion of the low carbon circular economy. Not only
environmental but also economical reasons promote building retrofitting vs. demolition and new
construction [71].
These building adaptation practices will also help address climate change, optimal use of
energy resources, greenhouse emissions and secure energy supply in the coming years, by gradually
implementing Net Zero Energy Buildings and Positive Energy Districts.
The RGS platform results show the high retrofitting potential for the oldest Spanish regulations
(before 2006). Eight building models (Case 1–Case 8) have been developed with the dynamic simulation
program TRNSYS to characterize the energy performance of residential buildings for three climatic
zones (C1, D1, and E1), four Spanish construction regulations and different percentages of summer
shading on the windows. The potential is higher in houses than in blocks, being more remarkable in
single or isolated building configurations. In the case of blocks, the retrofitting potential is higher for
four-storey plants in comparison with seven and ten-storey plans. If the surface area of blocks is higher,
the energy-savings obtained are lower. The highest energy-saving potential is reached in warmer
climates (zones C1), while the lowest is reached in colder zones (zones E1). Analysing the influence of
external shadings on facades, this platform obtains higher impact on buildings constructed according
to stricter regulations and in single-family structures vs. blocks. Regarding climate impact, the annual
thermal load increases in colder climates due to the higher heating requirements. On the contrary,
the impact of shading is greater in warmer climates where the cooling demands are higher.

Local authorities and other stakeholders have to consider the retrofit potential as well as the
solar and geothermal resources to establish the priority areas of intervention. The expected energy
savings caused by the solar domestic hot water system have been computed by means of the f-chart
method assuming that each single house or flat is provided with a 2 m2 flat solar collector tilted 25◦
towards the South. Results show that almost all the territory has solar savings over 30%, which is
the minimum required by the Spanish regulations for a single-family house. The new tool allows
evaluation of the general performance of solar installations, showing relevant differences in the same
climate zone. The annual efficiency is almost constant in all climate zones studied; the energy savings
show great variation, particularly in zones C1 and D1. In the case of zone C1, the solar energy savings
vary from 29.6% to 51.3%. A similar scenario is obtained for the D1 climate zone, where the solar
savings range from 26.8% to 57.4%. South-West postal districts of the Principality of Asturias present
high values of the annual average of daily global solar irradiation on horizontal surfaces as well as high
retrofitting potential. However, the highest values of thermal conductivity are located in north-west
and east postal districts. These geological data obtained are used to calculate the length of the required
geothermal ground-heat exchanger. Energy demand per surface of each building has been calculated
considering the thermal envelope characteristics and the building typology. The proposed system,
based on heat pump technology, is powered by geothermal energy and an input of electrical energy.
The geothermal system is compared with conventional natural gas or gas oil systems in terms of CO2
emissions. A comparison of the high influence of thermal conductivity on the length of the geothermal
exchanger, for the same type of building, is made in three climatic zones (C1, D1, E1).
On the one hand, the influence of thermal conductivity on the length of the exchanger can be
appreciated, requiring fewer drilling meters for higher conductivities. Furthermore, it can be seen that
within the same location the hydrogeology is different, requiring different lengths of exchanger for
each particular case. On the other hand, the factors that most influence energy and environmental
savings are the improvement of the building envelope and the replacement of the conventional heating
system by the geothermal one. Greater benefits are obtained for old buildings with large surfaces,
with insulation or with old heating systems based on gas oil boilers. This has a direct effect on the
initial investment and subsequent amortization.
The implementation of both renewable technologies in residential buildings reduces the CO2
emissions to the atmosphere, with the geothermal pumps being more profitable than the solar thermal
panels due to the percentage of annual thermal load cover by each technology.
It should be noted that this accessible GIS platform provides both the solar and geothermal sectors
with relevant information on these renewable resources in the areas of possible implementation, solving
one of the major obstacles in the implementation of low enthalpy geothermal energy and solar thermal
energy in urbanized areas. Therefore, the exploitation of this GIS platform by different public and
private organizations is forecast. Regarding the public entities, the platform is mainly destined to be of
use to environmental government areas of the Principality of Asturias, as well as to local authorities,
helping them with decision-making in the matter of energy efficiency strategies and setting priorities
for programs linked to rehabilitation plans and energy actions. On the other hand, the possibility
of commercialization to private companies is focused mainly on the technical or engineering sector.
These companies could find, in this platform, valuable information about the areas to which they could
direct their main efforts to promote their activity.
