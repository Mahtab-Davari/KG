Abstract: At a global level, the need for energy efficiency and an increased share of renewable
energy sources is evident, as is the crucial role of cities due to the rapid urbanization rate. As a
consequence of this, the research work related to Positive Energy Districts (PED) has accelerated in
recent years. A common shared definition, as well as technological approaches or methodological
issues related to PEDs are still unclear in this development and a global scientific discussion is needed.
The International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme (IEA EBC)
Annex 83 is the main platform for this international scientific debate and research. This paper
describes the challenges of PEDs and the issues that are open for discussions and how the Annex 83
is planned and organized to facilitate this and to actively steer the development of PEDs major leaps
forward. The main topics of discussion in the PED context are the role and importance of definitions
of PEDs, virtual and geographical boundaries in PEDs, the role of different stakeholders, evaluation
approaches, and the learnings of realized PED projects.

1. Introduction
The increase in the energy consumption, the intensification of global warming and
policies to reduce the need of fossil fuels have created interest in renewable energy sources
(RES). The 2015 Paris Agreement has put more emphasis on international efforts to reduce
carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions [1]. According to the International energy agency (IEA),
the use of RES has increased significantly in recent decades. For instance, photovoltaic
(PV) energy generation increased from 91 GWh in 1990 to 554,382 GWh in 2018 and wind
energy has increased from 3880 GWh in 1990 to 1,273,409 GWh in 2018 [2]. According to
IEA, around 26% of the global energy was provided through RES in 2018 [2]. With plans
to increase the share of the RES by 32% in the European Union (EU) by 2030 [3] and to
further reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 [4], it is expected that the share of RES
will increase on a yearly basis. However, the challenge still remains on the variability of
the RES generation, which could result in putting pressure on the grid and ultimately,

in compromising the stability of the grid. Thus, power grids and energy systems have to
be designed in a way that can regard such issues and challenges.
1.1. Impact of Buildings and Districts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions
An important sector that contributes significantly towards climate change and global
warming is the building sector. Buildings account for 30–40% of global final energy
consumption [5] and nearly 40% of the global CO2 emissions. In the last decade, policies
such as the Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD) have been introduced to
address the issue, aiming to decarbonize the building stock by 2050 and to reach nearly
zero energy buildings (NZEBs) [6]. In 2009 ambitious energy and climate targets were
set for 2020 (20% greenhouse gas emission reduction, 20% increase in efficiency and 20%
increase renewable energy). After ten years, the EU in general is on track to achieve these
targets, showing that GDP can be increased while reducing carbon emissions. In fact,
by 2017 the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased by 21.7% compared to the
1990 GHG emission levels [7]. In Canada, the residential sector is responsible for 16.6%
of the energy consumption and 12.9% of GHG emissions [8]. Between 1990 and 2016,
the residential sectors emissions have been reduced by 30.2 Mt CO2 (27% of total) [8]
through enhancing building codes, applying minimum energy performance standards
for appliances, improving energy monitoring systems and home retrofits. Under the
Paris Agreement, Canada committed to reducing its GHG emissions up to 30% below the
2005 level by 2030 [8]. Moreover, Canada announced a plan to set Canada on a net-zero
emissions pathway by 2050. Canada’s 2030 GHG emissions target is 511 Mt CO2 eq, given a
2015 level of 815 Mt CO2 eq [8]. Between nine principal sectors, buildings are committed to
a 47 Mt CO2 eq reduction [8]. The key priorities are increasing clean electricity, developing
and implementing greener buildings and communities, and developing and implementing
nature-based climate solutions.
The 2015 Paris Agreement has put more emphasis on international efforts to reduce
CO2 emissions, where urban areas with a 70% share of global emissions have a key role.
Accordingly, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals include as goal 11
“sustainable cities and communities” with the aim of supporting the transition towards
low-carbon cities, in a general framework which also points towards, e.g., climate action,
affordability, and clean energy. In 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed, the EU
planned to move further ahead and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.
In order to tackle this challenge and to lead the global energy transition, the EU Commission
proposed in 2016 a set of new and ambitious rules known as the Clean energy package for
all Europeans [5]. Therefore, to reach the emission reduction goals it is important to focus
both at the energy systems level and at the buildings or district level.
1.2. Near and Net Zero Energy Building/District Concepts
Different NZEB, net zero energy or even zero energy building (ZEB) concepts have
been developed and implemented in the building sector all over the world. According to
the ZEB definition, “the building can be considered as ZEB after showing through actual
measurements that the energy delivered to the building is less than or equal to the onsite
renewable exported energy” [9]. Similarly, according to Article 2 of the Energy Performance
of Building Directive (EPBD), the Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) concept states that
“’nearly zero-energy building’ means a building that has a very high energy performance,
as determined in accordance with Annex I. The nearly zero or very low amount of energy
required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources,
including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby’” [10]. A similar
concept exists in the United States of America (USA) that is called net ZEB [11] it states
that annually a building uses less or equal energy generated from the renewable energy
on a primary energy basis. Similarly, concepts exists in other places [12] such as net zero
energy (NZE) housing in Canada [13], zero emission building in Australia [14] and in
Korea [15], etc. However, ZEBs or Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEBs) mostly relate to

occur in DHCN with the introduction of electrical heating systems (e.g., heat pumps) and
prosumers, as well as the injection of hydrogen in natural gas grids. Utilizing waste heat
streams from buildings and selling the waste heat to the DHCN is expected to grow [24,25].
Another aspect raised in the building sector is the inclusion of electro mobility within
buildings and districts, such as a charging station for an electric-vehicle (EV). However,
although the transport and mobility sector contributes 27% of the emissions in Europe,
the NZEB/ZEB concepts [26] and EPB certificates (such as the ISO52000) usually omit the

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

EV load in the calculation process. Nevertheless, the transport and mobility sector are becoming increasingly important factors in the energy supply of populated districts, since the
share of EVs is increasing rapidly at the global level. In fact, it is expected that by 2030,
EV usage will increase to 44 million cars globally [27]. Many cities around the world are
thus already including electrification of mobility in their city plans [28]. These EVs would
increase the demand and load on the grids and they can also be used as peak savings with
batteries. Other aspects, such as building mass and energy storage, have to be included in
future energy systems [29]. Energy storage can provide needed flexibility and resilience to
buildings [30]. All the above-mentioned issues and challenges call for large changes and
renovation of the grids and energy systems so that all the issues can be addressed in an
integrated and holistic way. These changes are needed at the district level rather than at
the building level. Moreover, the aspects on better coordination between sectors (energy,
building, mobility, etc.) and better integration of technologies (e.g., RES, EVs and other
NZEB technologies) are other reasons to move from the building to the district level [31].
Various studies on buildings, smart grids and intelligent buildings have been carried
out [32–34]. The flexibility and use of new technologies such as RES and storage can be
increased by focusing at the district level, rather than at the building level. The research
and testing of solutions are already moving from the building level to the district level.
This would not only provide technically feasible solutions but also economically viable
ones [35]. For example, the district energy refurbishment approach, already tested in some
EU projects, leans on a set of innovative system integration activities at the district level
and is geared to make the targeted district model robustly scalable and replicable and to
maximize the multiple benefits creation [36,37]. Moreover, this would solve the grid and
building-related emissions issues at a larger level. However, although the building level
research on such topics has become well-structured in the past few years, the district level
or, in particular, the positive energy district (PED) field is quite new, and it is developing
on academic, scientific and business levels with time [38] as also shown in Figure 1.
1.4. Positive Energy District (PED) Concepts, Aims and Connection with Zero Energy Concepts
and International Energy Agency Energy in Building and Communiy (IEA EBC) Annexs
A PED can be generally described as a district within a city that generates more
energy than it consumes on an annual basis [39]. The aim of PED is not only to generate
surplus energy, but rather to minimize the impact on the centralized grid by promoting
higher self-consumption and self-sufficiency. The PED should offer options to increase the
onsite load matching by allowing the integration of long and short-term storage and smart
controls for improving the energy flexibility. This district level concept and its impact on
flexibility, RES and storage integration are still in early stages globally, as shown in Figure 1.
Therefore, a holistic approach is needed to define, develop, model and validate the PED
concept in order to consolidate the PEDs. Moreover, as shown in Figure 2, the past research
focus has been mainly on the ZEBs, intelligent buildings, energy efficiency, NZEB, RES,
etc., at the global level. Therefore, Annex 83 will provide the needed platform to discuss
and create a framework of PEDs considering the different urban contexts of the globe.
According to the solar district heating database [40], there are approximately 195 pilot cases
of different capacities of solar-based district heating systems operating in Europe. However,
there is currently no insight into how the PEDs and their use in the future districts and cities
would be able to provide the consumer-centric, bi-directional grids and districts that are
emission-free and flexible. The PEDs can utilize the benefits of the building thermal mass,
different typologies of energy storages, RES, electric mobility, demand side management,
and flexibility options [30,41–43]. The district can also provide the advantage of shifting
the demand, based on the functionality of the various buildings present in the district and
this may assist in improving the energy flexibility at the building [44] and grid levels [45].
International Energy Agency Energy in Buildings and Communities (IEA EBC) Annex 83Positive Energy Districts was developed to provide research contributions towards these
fields, based on the outcomes of other IEA Annexes such as Annex 51 [46], Annex 60 [47],
Annex 64 [48], Annex 67 [34], and Annex 73 [49].

at the global level in order to create carbon neutral cities for the future. This Annex is one
of the first initiatives that aims to coordinate such research on PEDs at the global level.
The PED concept may have its limitations depending on the location, local regulations,
technology and urban contexts. For example, Denmark’s regulations force buildings to
be connected to the green district heating network (which will be imports for the PED),
leading to higher investments to achieve a positive balance. At the same time, Denmark
allows the creation of district heating cooperatives, allowing them to lower the prices of
the user [50]. The prosumer regulations are also different within the European Union
(EU). While Spain’s self-consumption regulation makes the balance on a monthly basis,
Latvia does so on a yearly basis and both of them do not reimburse users if the exported
energy exceeds their electricity consumption. The Netherlands make the balance yearly,
reimbursing prosumers for their exports at the end of the year [51]. Spain and Latvia
limit the installed capacity per each user (except if they form a cooperative) while the

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

Netherlands enable the concepts of aggregators, virtual power plants or peer-to-peer energy
exchange. Looking to global contexts, China has very large regions, and not all of them
are connected by means of an electric grid [52], which can mean that it is harder in some
contexts to apply PEDs. A potential solution to this may be micro-grids with self-sufficient
districts (also known as energy islands in some of the literature). The focus of Annex 83 is
on the development of the PED concept and its application at the global level, therefore this
Annex involves researchers and experts from around the world (i.e., from Europe, USA,
Canada, China, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, South Korea, Turkey etc.) to include
the global perspective and challenges as discussed above.
In order to reach the PED, the district first requires higher energy-efficient buildings,
secondly the use of carbon free energy renewable energy sources to meet the remaining
demand and thirdly cascading local energy flows by making use of any surpluses. Better
and smarter controls are needed to match the demand and supply locally and also to
minimize the liability on the grid and maximize the effectiveness of PED on the grid.
Moreover, since the objective is also to go beyond the fulfillment of a mere mathematical
positive energy balance, a wide spectrum of initiatives and parallel objectives are included
in the definition of PEDs including social concerns, inclusiveness, solutions to energy
poverty, spatial and civic planning of the person building in addition to district wide
considerations on the transportation networks and design optimization.
The intrinsic multi-dimensional nature of the design of PEDs requires the contemporary involvement on different levels: mathematical and energy modeling, social, environmental, economic performance assessment, interaction with stakeholders, diffusion of
know-how in the territory investigated and creation of PEDs are able to spark the diffusion
of these concepts on large scales.
The transition towards carbon neutral districts require multisector and multidimensional solutions. It embraces a synchronized and parallel development of instrumental
technologies, public perceptions of building energy technologies, new economic paradigms,
assessment approaches, and tailored business models. In this case cities can provide and
act as a living lab to facilitate and incubate new technologies and solutions. This is needed
in order to co-design all-inclusive packages of citizen’s centric carbon-free energy solutions.
A common platform is needed to facilitate such collaborations and Annex 83 will focus on
providing it with the ultimate aim to generate opportunities for creating such interdisciplinary solutions. Table 1 shows some of the practical application of PEDs or zero energy
concepts available.

1.6. Aim and Scope of This Article
The aim of this article is to show the benefits and importance of scientific global level
cooperation on the topic of PEDs. This article lays down and presents all the activities
planned under each task and the objective of each tasks/subtasks under the proposed
Annex 83 platform at the global level. This article provides an introduction to readers
about the activities that are planned and in progress in IEA EBC Annex 83. It presents and
provides for the Annex 83 project plan. Moreover, it introduces the current global interest
of researchers in PEDs. This Annex will be conducted at the global level, in order to include
a global perspective to the PEDs, as the topic is novel and requires a global collaboration.
The activities and tasks have recently started in Annex 83 from November 2020 and
will continue up until the end of 2024. Under the planned Annex, all the outcomes, findings, new tools, and results will be presented and disseminated on various platforms and
in scientific journals, reports, and books. As Annex 83 will progress for the next four
years, all the challenges, such as climactic, geographical, regulatory framework, boundary
conditions, stakeholders, technological approaches, as well as findings, will be disseminated. A flexible working definition of PED, case studies, development of methodologies,
and tools will also be provided and discussed under the Annex.
2. IEA ECB Annex83 Positive Energy Districts: Objectives of the Annex
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has established an Implementing Agreement
on Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC). The function of the EBC program is to
undertake research and provide an international focus for buildings and districts energy
efficiency. Tasks are undertaken through a series of “Annexes”, so called because they are

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

8 of 17

legally established as annexes to the EBC Implementing Agreement. (https://www.ieaebc.org/ebc/about, accessed date: 20 November 2020).
The largest benefits arising from participation in EBC are those gained by national
programmes, such as leverage of R&D resources, technology transfer, training and capacitybuilding. Countries lacking knowledge can benefit from the experiences of those with
more expertise, thereby avoiding duplicated research efforts (https://www.iea-ebc.org/
ebc/about, accessed date: 20 November 2020).
The IEA EBC Research strategy states as an objective the following: “the creation of
holistic solution sets for district level systems taking into account energy grids, overall
performance, business models, engagement of stakeholders, and transport energy system
implications”. Annex 83, Positive Energy District answers directly this objective (https:
//www.iea-ebc.org/strategy, accessed date: 20 November 2020).
The international cooperation between research institutions from different parts of
the world brings many opportunities. Sharing of experiences between different climate
regions, cultures and economic systems enables researchers to develop globally sustainable
solutions that are implementable around the world. The overall knowhow and understanding, not only on PEDs, but on society and city development, is increased by an active
inclusion of a wide range of stakeholders.
2.1. Objectives
The aim of Annex 83 is to develop an in-depth framework for the devising of PEDs
including analyzing the technologies, planning tools and the planning and decision-making
processes related to positive energy districts. Experience and data to be used in the Annex
will be gained from demonstration cases.
Annex 83 aims to enhance the cooperation of PED development at an international
level through collaboration within the initiatives of the IEA. The main objectives of Annex
83 are:

•

•

•

•

•

Objective 1: Map the relevant city, industry, research, and governmental (local, regional,
national) stakeholders and their needs and roles to inform the work for Objectives 2, 3, 4,
and 5. The main purpose of this is to ensure the involvement of the main stakeholders in
the development of relevant definitions and recommendations.
Objective 2: Create a shared in-depth framework of the definition of PED by means of
a multi-stakeholder governance model. So far, international activities have developed
generalized definitions that leave many questions open.
Objective 3: Develop the needed information and guidance for implementing the
necessary technical solutions (on the building, district, and infrastructure levels) that
can be replicated and gradually scaled up to the city level, giving an emphasis to the
interaction of flexible assets at the district level and also economic and social issues
such as acceptability.
Objective 4: Explore novel technical and service opportunities related to monitoring
solutions, big data, data management, smart control, and digitalization technologies
as enablers of PEDs.
Objective 5: Develop the needed information and guidance for the planning and
implementation of PEDs, including both technical planning and urban planning.
This includes economic, social, and environmental impact assessments for various
alternative development paths.

2.2. Organisation and Methodology of Annex 83
From various projects (as shown in Table 1) it is found that firstly, for each project,
there is a certain definition of the concept, framework, and key performance indicators which are defined and laid down based on the local conditions and regulations,
etc. Secondly, the technical framework, technology such as buildings, renewable energy
sources, storage technology and simulation models are defined. Thirdly, the socio-economic
and social impact assessment criteria are defined. Fourthly, the real physical PED demo is

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

planned, implemented, operated, and measured. Lastly, the outcomes and learnings are
communicated for future learnings. A similar method and approach is used to design the
Annex 83 project plan and is communicated in this paper.
The Annex 83 is divided into four subtasks: Subtask A: definitions and context;
Subtask B: methods, tools and technologies for realizing positive energy districts; Subtask
C: organizing principles and impact assessment; and Subtask D: demos, implementation,
and dissemination.
Each subtask has a subtask leader (or co-leaders) and a vice-subtask leader. The subbetween

the tasks. This is imperative since many of the activities and results are dependent on the
other tasks.

scope will be then defined to narrow down the focus in this Annex, so that it is practical
while including the crucial elements. Furthermore, a literature review will be conducted
to map the existing studies, projects, and initiatives at the international level. This task
will be conducted in collaboration with other subtasks to align the scopes and foci within
Annex 83.
Subtask A will examine the evolvement of the PED concepts and outline the crucial
topics in the development of PEDs such as the spatial and temporal scales to be considered, essential technologies and system components, and regulations and implementation
barriers. Visualization of PEDs in the form of infographics will be developed to enhance
understanding of the PED concept. In addition, the stakeholders usually involved in
the development of PEDs will be identified and categorized. These stakeholders can be
urban planners, decision makers, energy system operators and planners, investors, construction companies, housing cooperatives, inhabitants, NGO’s, etc. The stakeholders
are a fragmented group with varying interests and levels of knowledge about energy
and sustainability topics. A framework will be defined for different objectives of PED
from different aspects of energy, economics, environment, and social context. Both the
stakeholders and the objectives will be input into the Subtask C activities. Meanwhile,
the KPI framework for PED will be finally developed in order to compare the performance
of the different PED archetypes and PED solutions (developed by Subtask B) and define
assessment models (Subtask C).
Based on case studies, common characteristics will be identified and summarized in a
“Reference” PED or PED archetype. The “Reference” PED will be used for simulation and
demonstration in other subtasks throughout the Annex. Moreover, this activity also plans
to establish a common process flow for PED development, using the “Reference PED” as a
case study to guide the development of PED projects.
3.2. Subtask B: Activities and Planned Methodology
The objective of Subtask B is to review which methods, tools, and technologies are
necessary for realizing PEDs. The work is divided into three sub activities: B1, aimed at
mapping the technical solutions (energy systems, infrastructures, etc.); B2, investigating
how flexibility can help to balance the energy flows; and B3, identifying data and tools
for modelling PEDs. The latter will model from two to three case studies to demonstrate
different control strategies at the district level.
From the case studies identified in subtask D, an inventory of the current PED technologies applied in PEDs will also be analyzed in sub-activity B1. Through this exercise,
the needed data for modelling and the best experiences of the different technologies will
be identified. From the revision and analysis of the different technologies applied, the technologies can be classified into different topics/areas (heating, cooling, electricity, storage)
and scopes (building, district, city). In each topic/area the technologies can be compared
and evaluated (using KPIs from subtask A and assessment evaluation from subtask C) in
terms of costs (LCoE, etc.) and regulatory, environmental, energy efficiency, and social
acceptance indicators, among others.
The focus of sub-activity B2 is to investigate how flexibility management can help to
balance energy flows within and beyond the PED boundaries. To do so, different decisionmaking processes (algorithms) and control strategies will be reviewed. The results from
the previous task (B1) and demo cases (Subtask D) will highlight and reveal the practical
challenges regarding the implementation of smart solutions at different levels, and also
future research and development needs in PEDs.
This activity will conduct a literature review on decision-making process (solutions for
decision makers, architects, citizens, energy experts, etc.) such as algorithms for planning
a PED.
A literature review on control strategies and algorithms will be conducted from the
information obtained in Subtask B1 and Subtask D. Research on data analysis techniques
and control strategy techniques (more advanced control systems, forecasting, load shifting,

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

11 of 17

peak saving, demand management, virtual power plants) is needed and will be conducted.
Other issues, such as demand response, flexibility, and data management (block chain)
which are useful for managing a PED will be considered. The result will be a comprehensive
inventory of the different control solutions (depending on the technology) that can be
applied at the building, district, and city levels. The different control strategies will be
assessed to identify the barriers/enablers of the different smart solutions.
The focus of sub-activity B3 is to investigate and identify the data and tools for
modelling a PED (from demand to the energy balance calculation) that can be used for
designing and operating a PED. Activity B3 will mainly focus on data libraries and how
these libraries can be used to model a PED. The idea is to generate a framework on how
to standardize libraries for urban/district data models (such as City GML) and how to
structure it.
To validate these urban scale models and to use data from subtask D case studies,
the libraries from B3 will be used for modelling district scale case studies. To do so, existing
tools and city platforms such as INSEL or City Energy Analyst, will be used. This will help
to analyze how to extract attributes from data libraries, to parametrize urban scale models,
and to apply different control strategies and assess them.
The result of sub-activity B1 will be a guideline of the best technologies applied in
PEDs in different urban scenarios. As an output, sub-activity B2 provides ideas for the PED
planning phase by city planners, citizens, etc. Furthermore, a prototype implementation
of interface algorithms for decision-making solutions for PED will be developed. Finally,
a report on urban scale modelling of PED districts (control-focused) and how flexibility
management can help to balance energy flows within and beyond the PED boundaries
will be carried out in sub-activity B3. Moreover, as an output, open-source libraries will
be created.
3.3. Subtask C: Activities and Planned Methodology
The objective of Subtask C is to investigate potential sustainable pathways towards
PED implementation. It aims at investigating both the impact assessment perspective as
well as the organizational aspects within PEDs: the idea is to investigate through a harmonized and parallel approach the three different dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, social) of PEDs while ensuring that all three directions are developed through
cultural contaminations and connections among them in a holistic and integrated way.
The activities are organized within a common framework that develops on three
different levels, following the approach towards the sustainability of PEDs. The structure
is vertically integrated.
The three major sub-activities are respectively:

•
•
•

Economic Assessment (Activity C1);
Environmental Assessment (Activity C2);
Humanities and Social Impact Assessment (Activity C3).

The sub-activity C1 will investigate the potential of economic impact assessment
methods for PED development and investigation. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will
be used and tested for PEDs and market strategies and initiative potential will be assessed.
Particular interest will be paid to renewable energy self-consumption models that are based
on sharing and trading (and financing) approaches.
The development of the activity will also encompass the listing of the most relevant
stakeholders to mobilize through the use of organizational models as well as the main
barriers and drivers to the implementation of PEDs from an economic perspective.
The sub-activity C2 focuses on the environmental impacts of PED, taking into consideration the different stages of the life cycle of PEDs (e.g., construction, operation, end-of-life).
To do so, various factors will be considered, both related to abiotic elements, as well as
biotic. The sub-activity will face the challenging task of framing impacts within adequate
time limits and scales by identifying relevant boundaries, such as environmental impacts,
which widely vary, from climate change to local air quality or biodiversity. More likely,

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

12 of 17

PEDs are going to deliver a combination of environmental benefits hardly able to be isolated. On the other hand, to realize a PED, regardless of whether they are done by new
buildings or the rehabilitation of an existing brownfield, new technologies are going to be
installed and natural resources consumed. Therefore, unwanted impacts on the ecosystem
may arise and resources consumed. Adequate KPIs and assessment tools are going to be
selected and applied to cope with this, and also the life cycle environmental perspective
has to be taken in consideration in order to identify potential trade-offs and avoid burden
shifts across impact categories or life-cycle stages.
The sub-activity C2 will investigate positive and negative impacts arising from the
implementation and diffusion of PEDs, their social acceptance and social inclusiveness.
It will also address organizational models and stakeholder engagement in PED development. Once again, social impacts are expected to be found at different levels, from the
single householder (e.g., enhanced well-being due to improved indoor comfort) to the local
community (social cohesion, social capital) or on a larger population. The peculiarity of
the PED’s energy system, calling for advanced and innovative solutions, energy sharing
and synergies among prosumers, but also implying some behavioral changes due to new
technologies, is an interesting and so far unexplored research field for social scientists.
Social impacts may be much more relevant as in previous smart energy transition projects
and needs specific KPIs. This includes both positive as well as unwanted negative impacts,
as, for example, gentrification because of an enhanced attractiveness of the district.
The main outcome of this subtask is to perform the synthesis of the lessons learned
and methodological developments by integrating the outcomes of previous ones into
innovative and interdisciplinary KPIs—connected to the three spheres of sustainability—
and develop sustainability inspired early design tools. Such tools may be based on life
cycle sustainability assessments or consider multiple benefits to provide evidence of the
contribution of PEDs toward the achievement of selected sustainable development goals.
A PED early design tool for sustainability assessment will be offered to support
the decision-making process of policy makers and stakeholders, and also try to leverage
investments (e.g., by exploiting the impact investing approach). Substantial collaboration
will be carried out with other subtasks and case studies.
3.4. Subtask D: Activities and Planned Methodology
Subtask D spans all the objectives by testing and demonstrating their operationalization in demonstration cases, reaching objective 5 to develop the needed information and
guidance for the planning and implementation of PEDs, including both technical planning
and urban planning. This includes economic, social, and environmental impact assessment
for various alternative development paths.
Firstly, the subtask will start the work with the scoping phase, with the aim to create a
framework for data collection from demo cases. References to other initiatives (e.g., SCIS,
JPI UE Booklet, and other references from outside EU) will be considered in order to take
inspiration for creating the data collection framework collaborative process and to fix the
main aspects to be built upon.
The data collection framework will be further elaborated into a template, which will be
structured to collect relevant information from demo cases. This activity has a twofold purpose: identifying relevant demo cases and creating a knowledge mass for the whole Annex.
A demo case call will be launched periodically (every 6 months) for the Annex partners
and supporters to identify demonstration activities at building blocks, districts, and city
levels relevant to the Annex. These can be related also to non-PED demonstrations as long
as they show a concrete value for the Annex activities. This is needed to gather detailed
information on the best practices, KPIs, stakeholder assessment data, technological data,
and key learnings from practical sites.
Secondly, the main outcomes of subtasks A, B, and C will be elaborated into a collection
of cross-domains best practices accessible for professionals, city planners, and municipal
stakeholders. They will be consulted in the early stages of this activity to identify their

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

13 of 17

burning needs and where they would need support for planning PEDs. This will give an
input to create the PED value chain from design and construction to operation, verification,
maintenance, renovation and end of life, etc. The guidelines will support the PED planning
in different dimensions: urban, suburban, and rural. The integration of PED in the existing
urban environment and its role in the city energy transition will also be addressed.
Lastly, a communication and dissemination plan is created with the purpose of outlining the communication, networking, and dissemination strategy, identifying relevant
initiatives (associations of cities, professionals, research organizations, initiatives organized
by institutions, etc.) for the Annex, describing how the Annex intend to keep up the
communication and networking activities. In this regard, the Annex Subtask leaders and
Operating Agents will nominate a set of ambassadors to be Annex representatives to the
selected initiatives. They will be responsible for setting up collaborative interactions and
cooperation events.
As discussed in Section 1, the Annex will seek continuous collaboration with other
networks, projects and IEA tasks/Annexes. It is planned to periodically (every 12 months)
launch initiatives and conference scouting calls for the Annex partners and supporters to
map the relevant PED communication and dissemination opportunities. Under subtask D,
the responsibility for all the latest information, updates, relevant content, and outcomes
from all the subtasks will be communicated through the Annex website.
4. Discussion and Conclusions
PEDs are seen as an ensemble of buildings of different typologies and functions (residential, commercial, industrial, public-owned, etc.) that are interconnected and produce
more energy than what is needed to cover the buildings’ demand on an annual basis.
Whether the energy demand of the infrastructure (water and waste management, transportation, street lighting etc.) should be included in the PED demands calculations, and the
mapping of the boundaries is a topic for discussion. So far, only the building’s energy
demands have been considered.
Becoming a PED is seldom the overall goal of a district being planned. Elements to be
considered (e.g., the type of Renewable Energy Source (RES), number of buildings, etc.)
and characteristics to be investigated (how it is organized, what is the governance model,
etc.) should be selected and adjusted according to the main objectives and aims identified
for creating a PED (improving the circular economy, ensuring high quality of life, etc.)
beyond the technical goal of optimizing the energy balance.
Depending on the selection and the definition, the calculated annual energy balance
will change. However, currently, all Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD)
and building standards such as ISO52000 are applied at the building level, not at the
district level, making calculation of the annual energy balance more complex and subject
to interpretations.
The elements considered within the boundaries will determine how the Positive
Energy District (PED) is defined and which loads should be considered for the calculation.
The majority of PEDs in Europe apply the dynamic-PED concept, with geographical
boundaries (such as PEDs in the projects ATELIER and MAKING-CITY as mentioned in
Table 1), which means that buildings are close to each other and dynamically exchange
energy (consuming and producing) with the energy grids. However, it is true that, when no
space is available within the district boundaries, it could be useful to apply detached
geographical patches or virtual boundaries. The main concern when applying the latter is
the ownership of the energy solutions and the business models of trading energy to the
PED over the virtual boundaries and how to guarantee the energy origin.
An effort to solve these challenges was done in the Sustainable Energy Positive & Zero
Carbon Communities (SPARCS) project (as mentioned in Table 1). To upgrade the interaction between energy producing, storing and consuming entities, a virtual positive energy
community is created. It is understood as a “variety of energy related actions virtually
connecting the multiple buildings across the district on various locations within and across

Buildings 2021, 11, 130

14 of 17

the city”. The entities can exchange energy based on “advanced control functionalities and
dedicated communication channels (Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
model, block chain infrastructure and prediction of the demand)”.
Some European projects are treating the PED concept in a different way. For example,
the MAKING-CITY project (as mentioned in Table 1) characterized their PEDs by local
renewable energy systems (RES) that interact dynamically with the grids (thermal and
electrical) and are located within the district boundaries, and aim to achieve an annual
positive energy balance incorporating building-related consumption. To do so, retrofit
measures to improve the energy efficiency of the buildings as well as including mature
technologies such as photovoltaics (PV), photovoltaic-thermal hybrid collectors (PVT),
building-integrated PV (BIPV), PV on water, waste digestion, geothermal heat pumps,
district heating, and thermal energy storage (such as boreholes, seasonal storage tanks, etc.)
are implemented. The concept will be tested in the two lighthouse cities (LH), Groningen
and Oulu, and replicated then in six follower cities (FC), taking into account the city needs
and priorities, on-site resource availability, MAKING-CITY PED (as mentioned in Table 1)
solutions and their business models through a decision-making journey emphasizing
citizen engagement. The ATELIER project (as mentioned in Table 1), on the other hand,
has two LHs, one district in Amsterdam and another one in Bilbao, with a number of very
ambitious building groups (retrofitted and new) of different typologies (tertiary, residential,
etc.) that are connected by means of grids (thermal and/or electric ones). Amsterdam
will participate and interact with the existing energy communities, as well as with the
grid, and will use the local waste for the production of biogas. Bilbao will retrofit an
industrial old district and connect its buildings with a geo-exchange loop. In a similar way
as in MAKING-CITY (as mentioned in Table 1), it will include Renewable Energy Source
(RES), retrofit building measures, electro-mobility and digitalization. Both follow the Smart
Energy Transition (SET) plan short definition, but their approach to replicate the concept in
FCs is made in a softer way, allowing each city to adapt the PED definition to their own
urban context.
Furthermore, several European networks are actively working on the topic of positive
energy districts. These include JPI Urban Europe, a network of European funding agencies
actively promoting and funding projects on Positive Energy districts, the Urban Europe
Research Alliance, a network of Research Organizations and Universities closely working
with and informing JPI Urban Europe, the Joint Program Smart Cities of the European
Energy Research Alliance (EERA JPSC), the group of the European Smart City Lighthouse
Cities, and the COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) action on Positive
Energy Districts. All of the European members of IEA Annex 83 are also involved in at least
one other initiative. This creates huge potential for collaboration, and many synergies will
be created by organizing joint meetings and conferences and by writing joint publications
and policy guidelines.
As discussed above and in Table 1, most of the districts and projects are under construction that can represent PEDs. However, few of the districts are partially operational,
as shown in Table 1. For instance, the drake landing solar community (DLSC) in Canada is
able to meet around 96% of the space heating demand of the district via renewable (solar)
energy and seasonal storage. The Flexens project in Åland is aggressively targeting to
meet 100% of the demand using renewables and to become a fossil-free island. Under the
Quartier la fleuriaye project in Carquefou, currently 6000 m2 of the roof area of the buildings (almost 300 houses) in the district are populated with the solar photovoltaic panels,
which cover almost 80% of the energy demand of the district. It is planned to increase the
total covered area of 15,000 m2 (almost 600 h) to provide excess energy to the district so
that it can become a PED. Similarly, under the Zero Energy District Accelerator project
in Arvada, Colorado, the buildings in the district are designed to be zero energy and as
a result the building’s life cycle costs are lower than the traditional buildings. Therefore,
the building owners are saving not only in terms of reduced emissions, but also in terms
of electricity price inflation and tax incentives. The owners are open to invest in new

technologies such as passive building design, solar panels and ground source heat pumps
etc., to become better.
The challenges raised above in the introduction section indicates that the PEDs are
complex and multi-disciplinary in nature. Moreover, it has various challenges depending
on the climate, location, regulations, technologies, key performance indicators, and urban
context etc., and this requires a scientific global discussion. Many learnings can be done by
exchanging experiences from different projects, knowledge, and cases around the world.
In the future, climate adaptation will become more important, which will bring new
challenges to the planning of the urban environment and PEDs. Energy poverty might
also become a bigger challenge than today due to increased immigration levels caused,
among other things, by climate change. The detailed definition, key performance indicators
and framework of PEDs will be discussed, developed and published in the future work as
the Annex 83 progresses up until 2024. Moreover, all the issues, challenges, methodologies,
technological solutions, and roles of the stakeholders will be discussed and developed
under the subtasks (mentioned above) which will carried out in Annex 83.
Annex 83 is the main platform for this scientific discussion in the coming years. Different
urban contexts will be covered in the different subtasks within Annex 83 to create a global
framework of the concept, as well as to identify the barriers and enablers of PEDs. This will
be possible thanks to cooperation between the partners involved in the Annex, with expertise
from different fields and from all over the world. Canada, with the involvement of Concordia
University, will give a perspective on urban scale modelling. Japan, thanks to Tokyo University, will give an overview of the different decision-making methodologies and on flexibility
management. Different expertise from Europe and around the world, with the involvement
of key actors and coordinators of current PED projects, will contribute to translating theory
into practice and to test on the ground the latest findings.
