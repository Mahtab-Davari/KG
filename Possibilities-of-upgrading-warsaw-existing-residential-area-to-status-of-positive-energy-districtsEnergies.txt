Abstract: This paper analyses possibilities of refurbishment of Warsaw’s residential buildings towards standards of the Positive Energy District. The annual final energy consumption in the city
in 2019 for the district heating was 8668 GWh, gas (pipelines) was 5300 GWh, electricity from the
grid was 7500 GWh, while the emission of the carbon dioxide was 5.62 × 109 kg. The city consists
of 18 districts, which are heterogeneous in terms of typology and structure of buildings. The great
variety of buildings can be seen, for example, by the annual final energy demand for space heating
and hot water preparation per unit of room area. This annual index ranges from over 400 kWh/m2
in historic buildings to 60 kWh/m2 in modern buildings. A reduction in the consumption of nonrenewable energy sources and carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved by improving the energy
standard of residential buildings and by using renewable energy sources: solar energy, geothermal
energy and biogas. The potential barriers for achieving the status of a positive energy district, for
example, problems connected with ownership, financing new investments and refurbishment and
legal boundaries, have been identified. Moreover, changing the existing electrical grid and district
heating systems in urban areas in Warsaw requires comprehensive modernization of practically the
entire city’s infrastructure.

The first intensive measures aimed at improving energy security appeared in response
to the fuel crisis of 1973 [1]. Indirectly, this global shock also contributed to increasing the
importance of environmental protection to preserve the environment for future generations.
There are several standard actions aimed at reducing the burden of harmful substances in
the environment: rationalization of needs, improvement of broadly understood efficiency,
and increased use of “clean” technologies to meet the needs.
In the residential buildings sector, these activities are mentioned:
- rationalizing the behaviour of building users (residents),
- rationalizing the internal systems operation,
- reduction of heat losses in buildings by improving the thermal insulation of the
envelope,
- recovery of heat discharged to the environment, e.g., from ventilation air, domestic
sewage,
- improving the energy efficiency of all technical devices and systems.
Nevertheless, it is not enough just to try to reduce the energy demand to meet the
needs. Hence the idea of using “clean” technologies that do not burden the environment,
especially renewable energy ones, have consequently led to the creation of “nearly zeroenergy”, “zero-energy” and “energy-positive” buildings in terms of final energy and/or
primary energy. The assessment also concerns the balance of emissions of harmful solid
and gaseous substances, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2 ).

In the European Union, these activities are directed, and at the same time supported, by
the Directives. For example, Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings [2] has brought lasting
change in the Polish construction law and regulations relevant to the technical requirements
of newly constructed buildings and buildings under refurbishment [3]. Nowadays, a
comprehensive approach to energy conservation and environmental protection issues,
linked to climate change problems, is extremely valuable and is evident in Polish national
energy policy [4]. The energy and climate policies have been linked very strongly and
utilisation of renewable energy technologies has become one of the basic elements of both.
New or renovated buildings are evaluated on the basis of energy consumption of
non-renewable primary energy for space heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot water
and lighting. It is also necessary to determine CO2 emissions and the share of renewable
energy sources in meeting the energy demand [3,5].
The City of Warsaw is actively engaged in activities aimed at rationalizing and reducing energy use. An example of completed actions include action plans for sustainable
energy consumption for Warsaw by 2020 [6] and investigations on the development of the
Warsaw housing standard [7]. Warsaw, in cooperation with the local authorities of Austria,
Germany and Italy, took part in the “Cities on Power” project (2011–2014), with the aim
to increase the use of renewable energy in urban areas. One of the results was estimation
of the possibilities of using renewable energy sources in Warsaw [8]. Future planning has
been performed for the 2050 perspective and is constantly updated [9]. In 2016, the City of
Warsaw began participating in the Cities Council of the EERA (European Energy Research
Associations) Smart Cities Joint Program.
In 2019, at the capital city of Warsaw, the Office of Air Protection and Climate Policy
was established by integration of four different former Offices. The new Office’s tasks
include preparing and updating action plans in the field of air protection and climate change
and elaborating reports on their implementation, including cooperation with competent
authorities in the preparation of higher-level programs (regional, national) [10]. Other
examples can be mentioned, e.g., the Municipal Climate Adaptation Plan [11], and the
Low-Emission Economy Plan for the Capital City of Warsaw [12]. Among the numerous
recommended actions, the introduction of solutions increasing the energy independence of
the city, including increasing the share of energy from renewable sources, was mentioned.
What is really important is that plan was the result of joint work of residents, entrepreneurs,
representatives of various types of organizations and the City of Warsaw.
In Section 2, administrative characteristics of Warsaw are presented, and some historical facts are also mentioned. Because of the topic of the paper, the housing stock and
energy sector are analysed with more attention. Considerations presented in Section 2 give
the background for more detailed analysis of a very specific situation in terms of supplying
heat to end users in Warsaw using a central district heating system. This analysis is carried
out in Section 3. It can be noticed that with having such a well-developed district heating
system, it is difficult to implement new investments in energy systems that use solutions
other than connecting new buildings to the existing network. However, if new housing
estates are built in an area that does not have access to the central energy systems, then the
extension of the existing energy network may be technically too complicated and, consequently, too expensive. As a result, it is more reasonable to build new local energy systems
in accordance with the current requirements of energy conservation and environmental
protection. Consequently, this provides the basis for the use of energy from renewable
sources available in the area of the city. Section 4 is therefore devoted to the presentation
of the theoretical potential of using renewable energy sources in the city and its outskirts.
Section 5 includes subchapters devoted to a different renewable energy, the theoretical
potential of which in Warsaw or on its outskirts indicates the possibility of its use for utility
purposes. However, possible and effective use can be limited due to specific location,
environmental or legal aspects, which are also mentioned in Sections 5 and 6. Section 6
briefly presents what should be done in order to achieve the goals set for the Positive

According to the data [9], buildings constructed in the period of 1945–1970 have the
largest share of the total number of buildings in Warsaw (26.39%). The share of relatively
new buildings constructed after 2002 accounts only for 4.60%.
The final as well as primary energy consumption indices depending on the construction period show how different buildings in terms of the energy efficiency are in

Low thermal energy buildings can be improved through the typical retrofit methods:
reduction of thermal transmission of the building external partitions (e.g., windows, walls,
roofs), elimination of the existence of thermal bridges, improvement of efficiency of heating
systems as well as hot water preparation (e.g., exchange of heat source, introduction and
optimization of energy control strategy), improvement of ventilation system and heat
recovery from the exhausted air. The possible effects of the thermo-modernization in two
variants, depending on the construction period and type of a building, of two variants are
presented in the Table 3 [20].

The first variant “standard” means reaching the level of the reduction when current
requirements are fulfilled [3], while “deep” means the application of more intensive technical upgrading actions, up to reaching the maximal possible effects assuming use of new
but conventional technologies. It is interesting that the application of the current technical
possibilities, even in buildings that have recently been put into use, allows for reducing the
demand for final energy in residential buildings by approximately 35% to almost 40%. It
is possible mainly due to the reduction of the heat demand for heating the ventilation air,
e.g., replacing gravity ventilation with a mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery.
It is characteristic for old buildings that no changes in their external appearance
are possible if they are under conservator’s protection. Therefore, in such buildings, the
thermal insulation of the external partitions can be added only from the inside of the
building. The effectiveness of such treatments is low, and reduction of energy consumption
does not exceed 20%. In many cases there is no possibility to install solar collector systems
or PV systems due to heritage protection, so the old quarters of Warsaw are not so attractive
in terms of generating energy on-site (locally). The most interesting in terms of retrofit are
groups of buildings built in the 1970s and later, with the annual final energy consumption
index for space heating and hot water preparing at a level of 220 kWh/m2 . In such cases
the possible reduction of energy demand reaches 40%, but it is still too low for reaching
positive energy building status.

4.5. Hydropower
Warsaw is located on the Central Masovian Lowland on the Vistula River, with no
access to the sea. Although within the city limits the Vistula is 28 km long, the use of

Energies 2021, 14, 5984

14 of 17

hydropower in Warsaw is not taken into account due to inadequate conditions, i.e., low
slope of the land and high density of buildings [31]. The use of smaller rivers, streams or
existing water channels with low and variable water flow is currently not considered.
It is worth adding that about 40 km to the north of Warsaw there is the D˛ebe Hydro
Power Plant, which was established in the 1960s [32]. The installed capacity of this power
plant is 20 MW, and the average annual energy production is about 91 GWh. This power
plant directly supplies the Polish power system with energy.
5. Towards Positive Energy Districts in Warsaw and Risks to Achieving This Goal
As shown in the previous section, in Warsaw there is a theoretical potential for the use
of renewable energies. It should be noted, however, that the use of renewable energies is
a rational solution only if there is a reduction in energy demand for traditional methods,
which in this case means reducing the energy demand of existing buildings or erecting
new ones in accordance with the latest energy and environmental standards.
In Warsaw, buildings in terms of energy performance are very diverse. In many cases,
it is possible to significantly improve their energy balance and reduce energy demand
through refurbishment and thermo-modernization. Nevertheless, in the historic part of the
city, as well as in densely built-up areas with too much energy demand for heating and
ventilation, achieving the “positive energy” standard can be difficult even with the current
state of technology.
In Polish climatic conditions, it is difficult to achieve energy self-sufficiency in urbanized areas based on only one type of renewable source because energy needs are too large
in relation to the possibility of coverage from monovalent-source renewable systems.
The solar energy is easiest to acquire on non-shaded surfaces, e.g., roofs. South
or south-west and south-east facades of buildings can also be used as long as they are
not shaded.
Low-temperature geothermal energy cannot directly supply a high-temperature heating network. It may be necessary to create local or neighbourhood networks to distribute
heat in a smaller area. Heat pumps will be required to raise the temperature. Later such
local systems equipped with heat pumps can be connected, thus competing with the
traditional district heating network.
The city of Warsaw “produces” large amounts of municipal waste. Some of them
are not recyclable or biodegradable. However, they can be used in modern plants for the
combined production of electricity and heat. Therefore, special attention can be put to
developing modern landfill gas energy plants. Up until now none of these landfill plants
operate in Warsaw or its surroundings.
Large areas of green spaces can also be a source of biomass. However, a traditional
combustion procedure should not be applied. It is necessary to use highly effective gasification processes as a preliminary energy treatment of biomass residues.
Potential barriers for implementation of renewable energy technologies and achieving
the status of a smart city with some positive energy districts should be identified and
mentioned. These are mainly problems with ownership, financing new investments and
refurbishment, and legal boundaries. Buildings may be private property, there may be
business ownership issues, and buildings may belong to a cooperative, housing community
or the city of Warsaw, or even a combination of the previously mentioned. This ownership
structure determines the ways and possibilities of financing the retrofitting measures. It
should be mentioned that land around buildings usually has a similar ownership structure.
This, in turn, can result in problems with the placement of energy systems outside the
building, and even applying extra thermal insulation to the building walls (the external
size of the building increases). The use of renewable energy, rationalization of the energy efficiency of existing systems, proper energy, water and waste management are an important
part of efforts to transform Warsaw into a smart city.

6. Conclusions
Sustainable development, carried out by taking into account the protection of the
climate and the natural environment, is de facto a political, economic, technical and social
problem even on the scale of the city.
Without the general awareness of the importance of these issues and, on the other
hand, social pressure, activities in this area may not be accepted due to the high costs of
implementing investments.
Moreover, the development of technology is still important in order to maximize the
widely understood effectiveness of technical solutions. It is also important to prepare
specialists who carry out comprehensive projects using renewable energy sources and take
care of the proper operation and maintenance of existing systems.
Increased outlays for the implementation of the change of the heat and energy supply
system require financial support, perhaps on preferential terms or from funds focused on
renewable energy.

The Capital City of Warsaw supports all activities aimed at reducing the consumption
of conventional energy, increasing the use of renewable energy sources and reducing
carbon dioxide emissions.
Increasingly stringent requirements in the field of thermal and energy protection of
buildings reduce both the demand for heating and ventilation and the required design
power of heat sources.
Lowering the required design heating load per area below 60 W/m2 (indicative value)
allows the use of low-temperature surface (e.g., floor) heating, which means that the
heat source can be a heat pump using, for example, low-temperature geothermal heat
available in Warsaw.
Achieving a positive energy standard by parts of the city with buildings with unsatisfactory energy performance may be economically unprofitable with the current
technical possibilities.
Due to the diversified ownership structure of land, buildings and accompanying
infrastructure, as well as in view of further city expansion plans, the easiest way
to implement the idea of energy-positive districts is to modernize the relatively recently established housing estates and design new ones with the “obligatory” use of
renewable energy sources.
The use of renewable energy sources instead of conventional fuels means a significant
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and environmental protection.
Changing the existing electricity and heat supply system for urbanized urban areas in
Polish conditions requires comprehensive modernization of practically the entire city
infrastructure.

Summarizing, it is very difficult to modernize large energy systems, which for many
years have been the only ones supplying energy to various types of energy users in the
city. However, it does not mean that nothing can be done. Warsaw, like many world
cities, is expanding to new areas and this causes opportunity for development of new local
energy systems based on renewables. Such systems can assure self-energy generation and
consumption, giving energy security for new districts.
Moreover, new districts can share their energy with other neighbourhoods. As a
consequence, the new districts can become Positive Energy Districts which will increasingly
interfere with the central energy systems of the city centre. New PEDs will absorb central
areas step by step, replacing ineffective central energy systems with new ones based on
renewable energy, giving energy independence to the whole city.
It should be underlined that the way to achieve complete energy independence for
the city is very complicated and rather long, which is what the authors have tried to
present in this paper. If thermal energy (a central district heating system) and electricity
(a central power grid) are available everywhere in the city, why does the energy sector,
developers, communities and inhabitants have to look for new “fuels” and innovative
energy conversion technologies, mainly those based on renewables? This is a question

Energies 2021, 14, 5984

and idea which should be answered by the municipalities as often as possible. Of course,
academic people and scientists and local “green” NGOs should help and support the
urgent need of the development of local efficient energy generation systems based on
locally available energy sources, such as renewables. They should foster the idea of sharing
energy in a modern way, which gives the basis for creating more Positive Energy Districts
in the city.
