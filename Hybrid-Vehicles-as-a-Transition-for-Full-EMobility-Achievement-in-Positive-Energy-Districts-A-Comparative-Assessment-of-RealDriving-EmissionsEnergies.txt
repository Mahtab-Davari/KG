Abstract: Air pollution is a major concern, particularly in developing countries. Road transport
and mobile sources are considered the root causes of air pollutants. With the implementation of
zero-carbon and zero-energy concepts at the district scale, cities can make great strides towards
sustainable development. Urban planning schemes are moving from mere building solutions to the
larger positive energy district (PED) scale. Alongside other technology systems in PEDs, increased
uptake of electro-mobility solutions can play an important role in CO2 mitigation at the district
level. This paper aims to quantify the exhaust emissions of six conventional and two fully hybrid
vehicles using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) in real driving conditions. The fuel
consumption and exhaust pollutants of the conventional and hybrid vehicles were compared in four
different urban and highway driving routes during autumn 2019 in Iran. The results showed that
hybrid vehicles presented lower fuel consumption and produced relatively lower exhaust emissions.
The conventional group’s fuel consumption (CO2 emissions) was 11%, 41% higher than that of the
hybrids. In addition, the hybrid vehicles showed much better fuel economy in urban routes, which is
beneficial for PEDs. Micro-trip analysis showed that although conventional vehicles emitted more
CO2 at lower speeds, the hybrids showed a lower amount of CO2 . Moreover, in conventional vehicles,
NOx emissions showed an increasing trend with vehicle speed, while no decisive trend was found
for NOx emissions versus vehicle speed in hybrid vehicles.

1. Introduction

with regard to jurisdictional claims in

Air pollution a major concern, particularly in developing countries, and it is a crucial factor in the outbreak of certain illnesses such as cardiovascular and respiratory
problems [1,2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that air pollution results in
almost 4 million premature deaths each year globally, which underscores the need to utilize
novel methods to control and mitigate these emissions. Moreover, the impact of some
pollutants, for example, CO2 , on climate and ecosystem conditions is enormously severe
and indisputable. CO2 is dominant among greenhouse gases (GHGs). According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA), the global amount of CO2 emissions reached its historic
high of 33.1 Gt with the transport section, especially road transportation, being responsible
for almost one-quarter of total CO2 emissions, which underlines the importance of mobile
sources of air pollution [3,4].
It should be noted that mobile sources are considered the root cause of air pollutants
alongside generating tire and road wear particles [5]. For instance, in Tehran, the capital

of Iran, mobile sources are accounted as the primary source of air pollutant emissions.
According to a recent study, mobile sources were responsible for 85% of the total aggregated
pollutants in Tehran, while stationary sources accounted for the remaining 15% [6].
According to international reports, approximately 80% of the world’s energy is consumed in urban areas and cities, with greenhouse gas emissions of up to 60% [7]. The
urban area populations are rapidly increasing, and it is estimated that almost 66% of
the world’s population will reside in urban parts by 2050 [8]. Cities implementing zerocarbon and zero-energy concepts on larger scales (districts) can make great strides towards
sustainable development.
Urban planning schemes must move from mere building solutions to the larger urban
scale, targeting positive energy districts (PEDs). PED is a novel concept that defines an
urban area where the energy consumed to run the district is lower than the renewable
energy generated within or outside the district. This contributes to cities’ energy system
transformations towards carbon neutrality, and this district approach allows considering
energy interactions between each building and the broader energy system at the local
level [9]. In fact, PEDs, due to the fact of their scalability potential, harnessing of renewable
energy (which is sometimes impractical for individual buildings), and achievement of a
high level of energy efficiency, are advantageous in building decarbonization and promising
pathway towards sustainable urban development [7,8,10,11].
The mobility and transportation sector has a share of almost 27% in GHG emissions
in Europe [12]. The EU requires passenger cars to reduce their CO2 emissions by 15% by
2025 and 37.5% by 2030 [13]. Sustainable mobility plays an important role in the future
of sustainable cities requiring greater efficiency in the transport system together with
behavioral change and urban transport electrification [14]. The inclusion of electric vehicles
in the fleet can effectively comply with the mentioned emission regulations.
Gradual penetration of electric vehicles (plug-in hybrids and battery-powered electric
vehicles) into the European market is being achieved, as their share increased from 0.06% in
2011 to 3.46% in 2019 in newly registered vehicles. Norway, Iceland, the Netherlands, and
Sweden showed a 56%, 19%, 16%, and 12% share of electric vehicles in newly registered
cars in 2019, respectively [15]. The IEA envisages that under the EV30@30 scenario, the
annual sales of electric vehicles will reach 44 million [16].
Increasing uptake of electro-mobility solutions can play an important role in CO2
mitigation at the district level, alongside other technology systems such as energy storage,
renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal), photovoltaic (PV) panels,
combined heat and power (CHP), and bioenergy. In fact, PEDs can incorporate the benefits
of electric vehicles, primarily through the implementation of charging infrastructures using
renewable energy sources. It is important to note that EVs have an impact on the grid due
to the related load and demands; therefore, their share in the PED grid must be taken into
account in district and city planning. Increasing EV technology penetration caused the
utilization of EVs in PEDs throughout the world. Several projects targeting EVs in district
planning are in the implementation stage including Quartier la fleuriaye, MAKING-CITY,
+CITYXCHANGE, ATELIER, PoCiTYF, SPARCS, SYN.IKIA and READY. These projects
harness EVs as a practical application alongside the other technology systems [17]. For
example, the EU-funded smart city project, PoCiTYF, considers e-mobility integration into
smart cities as one of the solutions towards energy management, decarbonization of the
mobility sector, and citizen’s mobility cost reductions [7].
Several solutions are being implemented progressively to decrease exhaust emissions
such as engine downsizing, alternative fuels, and incorporating novel after-treatment
systems. By electrifying the power system, hybrid engines can offer efficient fuel economy
and fewer exhaust emissions. It is accepted that hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have
relatively higher fuel economy and lower exhaust emissions than conventional internal
combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
Moreover, it is envisaged that in 2050, electricity will have a 13% share in supplying
needed energy in the transport section [18]. The Energy Information Administration (EIA)

Energies 2022, 15, 2760

and an IEA report also show an increasing trend and significant sales number of such
vehicles over the next few years [19,20]. Full hybrid electric vehicles, which use ICEs and
electric motors together, act as a bridge between conventional vehicles and electric ones
and are categorized as series, parallel, and power-split configurations based on power flow
and the relationship between the combustion engine and electric motor in power supply.
Hybrid vehicles reached a share of 4% in 2019 for new vehicle registration in Europe [15].
Measuring exhaust emissions and fuel economy is undoubtedly essential for predicting
the fleet electrification benefit for a district accurately. Laboratory tests using standard
driving cycles under controlled conditions are often criticized for not reflecting the vehicle’s
real emissions and fuel economy. In other words, the smooth pattern of driving cycles
along with the controlled conditions underestimates the real amount of exhaust emissions.
Accordingly, portable emission measurement system (PEMS) tests (currently mandatory
in Euro 6 alongside the standard laboratory tests) can contribute to estimating emission
factors under real driving conditions. In other words, PEMS tests represent real driving
emissions (RDEs) that are more realistic and reliable [21], because they can capture the
effect on emissions and fuel consumption of road traffic, road slope, ambient conditions,
etc. PEMS tests are required as part of the Euro 6 regulation, particularly for NOx and
particulate number measurement, and the obtained results from PEMS must not exceed
the multiplication of conformity factor and the laboratory results. Based on a report by the
International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), plug-in electric vehicles emit three
to four times more CO2 in real-world driving conditions compared to standard driving
cycles [22]. However, other novel methods, such as machine learning techniques with input
data from PEMS tests or the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test bench, have been recently
developed [23,24].
A few studies inspected the PEMS measurement of HEVs under RDE-based routes and
compared the exhaust emissions and fuel economy with conventional vehicles. Because this
study focused on passenger vehicles, only studies dealing with hybrid electric light-duty
vehicles are mentioned here, although PEMS studies are performed on heavy-duty HEVs
such as buses [25]. Huang et al. [26] compared the exhaust emissions and fuel economy of
two pairs of vehicles; each contained one hybrid vehicle (HV) and its conventional vehicle
(CV) counterpart. They conducted PEMS tests on three separate routes that included urban,
rural, and highway parts. They concluded that HVs had a higher fuel economy than CVs
(23–43% for the first pair and 35–49% for the second one). The fuel savings were more
noticeable in low-speed and urban conditions due to the combustion engine’s reducing
share. The fuel savings were diminished in highway conditions.
Furthermore, both HVs showed considerably higher carbon monoxide (CO) emissions
than CVs, and their exhaust gas temperatures declined strongly in low-speed parts. This
can be attributed to the hybrid system’s greater start–stop, which led to the temperature
variation in the three-way catalytic converter (TWC). Consequently, it impacted the TWC,
which reduced the oxidation process. Nitrogen oxides (NOx ) emissions were lower in HVs.
Bielaczyc et al. [27] examined one hybrid and one conventional vehicle’s exhaust
emissions utilizing PEMS. The RDE-based test route consisted of a 6 km urban part. The
test was performed two times in a similar procedure. The conformity factor (CF) was
defined in the article as the ratio of emissions in the PEMS test to the applicable limits.
Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were low in both vehicles, and the CF for HC was <<1. The
CO emissions were much higher, and the CF for the conventional vehicle was approximately
three, while CO emissions for the hybrid vehicle were an order of magnitude lower. In
addition, NOx emissions were very low; therefore, the emission factors of the conventional
and hybrid vehicles were 8 and 2.5 mg/km, respectively. There was a substantial difference
between the CO2 emissions of the conventional and hybrid vehicles. Hybrid vehicles
mitigated CO2 emissions by approximately 55% (132 vs. 284 g/km).
Wu et al. [28] explored the exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of two Toyota
Prius HEVs using PEMS and compared them with those of conventional gasoline and
diesel vehicles. The test route consisted of urban freeways with a total distance of 36 km.

Energies 2022, 15, 2760

They incorporated vehicle specific power (VSP) and the micro-trip method to inspect and
analyze the test results. They found that emissions and fuel consumption almost rose with
increasing VSP. The results demonstrated a 27–40% reduction in fuel consumption of HEVs.
Moreover, utilizing micro-trip analysis proved that, unlike conventional gasoline vehicles,
the CO2 emissions of HEVs were almost insensitive to speed change; thus, CO2 emissions
decreased by 35%.
In contrast with gasoline vehicles, NOx emissions of HEVs decreased as the average
speed diminished. A considerable 90% reduction in NOx emissions was observed for HEVs.
One of the most remarkable outputs of the paper was that the mitigation of emissions,
particularly CO2 and NOx , occurred in low-speed and congested traffic conditions. As a
result, the authors concluded that HEVs are desired substitutes for conventional gasoline
taxi fleets. They also employed economic analysis due to the fact of the reduction in fuel
consumption. The results showed that the payback period is about 2~3 years for HEVs.
Holmen and Sentof [29] conducted a PEMS test on two Toyota Camry vehicles (one hybrid
and one conventional gasoline vehicle). The test route comprised 51.5 km including urban,
suburban, and highway sections. The authors defined the benefit factor as the ratio between
the emission factors of a conventional vehicle and a hybrid vehicle. The benefit factor of
HEV CO2 varied from 0.9 (in higher amounts of VSP) to 6.4 at lower speeds and idle
conditions, which indicates the lower emission of the HEV at heavy and low-speed traffic
conditions. Additionally, the fuel consumption benefit factor of HEV vehicles were 10, 5,
and 2 for city, suburban, and highway conditions, respectively (with the average benefit
factor of 2.4 through the entire route). This implies that HEV had better fuel saving at lower
VSP and speeds.
A large PEMS measurement of 149 diesel, gasoline, and hybrid passenger cars was
carried out by O’Driscoll et al. [30]. The vehicles comprised 75 gasoline vehicles and two
hybrid ones. The test route consists of 83 km urban and highway parts. Hybrid vehicles
played a crucial role in mitigating CO2 emissions, especially in urban areas. The NOx
emissions of hybrid vehicles were 20 times lower than those of gasoline vehicles. An
assessment of the emissions of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle using PEMS was performed
by Graver et al. [31]. The tests were performed in eight different routes. The results proved
that the fuel consumption was roughly 30% lower in the charge-depleting (CD) than in
charge-sustaining (CS) mode. Moreover, the CD mode reduced CO and NOx emissions by
25% and 60% compared to the CS mode. Skobiej et al. [32] categorized plug-in vehicles into
three different classes based on their emissions obtained from the RDE test. In addition,
Wróblewski et al. [33] inspected the economic aspects of PHEVs and driving style impact
on energy consumption. Bagheri et al. [34] conducted an extensive literature review to
compare the HEV and conventional vehicles in terms of exhaust emissions. The authors
reached a contradiction for CO and PN emissions with 13% and 495% higher median values
in PEMS measurement for HEVs compared to conventional passenger vehicles.
Pielecha et al. [35] inspected the exhaust emissions and energy consumption of conventional, hybrid, and electric vehicles in RDE conditions and found that electric vehicles had
the lowest total energy consumption followed by plug-in hybrids, with 10% higher energy
consumption. In addition, conventional vehicles had the highest energy consumption (30%,
compared to electric ones). Similarly, Mamala et al. [36] found that the energy consumption
of a conventional vehicle was seven times higher than the plug-in one in the RDE test.
Furthermore, aside from tank-to-wheel emissions, Orecchini et al. [37] performed
well-to-wheel (WTW) analyses for different conventional and hybrid vehicles using the
RDE data and found a significant reduction in the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions
of hybrid vehicles compared to conventional ones.
In this paper, the exhaust emission behavior and fuel economy of several hybrid and
conventional vehicles with various weights and engine volumes were inspected using
PEMS measurement in real driving conditions along four different routes with urban
and highway types and flat and uphill slopes. As seen from the reviewed literature, the
emission and fuel consumption behaviors of the HEVs can be different, and sometimes

Four different RDE routes were chosen for the PEMS tests, including urban and
highway types with flat and uphill road grades, to incorporate into the test all conditions
and vehicle operating points. These routes were chosen to reflect the different drive cycles
and their impact on engine operating points. Highway routes are associated with more
cruising and engaging efficient parts of the engine operating map, while urban routes
consist of many start–stops, falling into inefficient zones of the engine map. Choosing these
routes led to a more accurate comparison between conventional and hybrid vehicles.
Figure 3 presents the selected routes on Google map, and Table 3 summarizes the
essential route characteristics. Road grade was obtained by averaging altitude difference
8 of 19
per 100 m during the route; it was also reported based on percentage in which 100%
represented 45◦ .

The tests excluded the cold-start part. In other words, before the test began, each
vehicle idled for five minutes until the coolant temperature reached a specific value (85 ◦ C).
Moreover, the same driver ran all the tests in order to lower the impact of driving style on
the results. Each route was repeated three times in each PEMS test, and each vehicle was
tested two times. The tests were conducted between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on different
days of the same week in autumn 2019.
In each PEMS test, the average emission factor (EF) and fuel consumption results were
calculated using Equation (1), with the weighted average scheme as follows:
EFoverall =

∑4i=1 (VKTi × EFi )
∑4i=1 VKTi

(1)

where i is the route index, EFi specifies the emission factor (or fuel consumption) of each
route, and VKTi indicates the mileage traveled by the ith route. In this study, the routes
were chosen in Tehran city, and the percentage of mileage traveled for each one (VKTi )
was obtained from the results in Reference [38], because they studied the same routes
using PEMS and reported the route usage percent. In fact, the multipliers of Equation (1),
VKTi , were obtained from the link-based activity data from the travel demand model. The
mentioned model, using 17,441 individual links in Tehran, has estimated the percentage
of kilometers traveled by passenger cars in Tehran city [39]. VKTi is equal to 18.3%, 9.9%,
65.2%, and 6.6% for R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively.
The velocity profile for four RDE routes, obtained in one the PEMS tests for CV1,
are depicted in Figure 4. It was essential to investigate the kinematic characteristics of
the RDE routes, which are helpful in understanding and analyzing the existing emission
behaviors of RDE routes. For this reason, some of the related kinematic parameters were
calculated and can be found in Table 4. Moreover, the standard drive cycle of the NEDC
(New European Driving Cycle) is included in Table 4. Comparing the kinematic parameters
of real-world cycles with a standard driving cycle indicated that the RDE routes were more
aggressive. A standard drive cycle of NEDC was chosen for comparison with the RDE
routes, since NEDC is the certification cycle for Euro 4 emission standards, and all of the
examined vehicles were Euro 4 certified.
From the dynamic viewpoint, the relative positive acceleration (RPA) was used in the
following form to investigate the acceleration and severity level of the driving cycles:
RPA =

∑in=1 ( ai × vi )
s

(2)

where ai indicates the positive acceleration at time step i, vi is the velocity at time step i,
and s is the total trip distance. The values of RPA were calculated for each RDE route and
for the NEDC. The RPA values are compared in Figure 5. It can be found that the overall
values of RPA for the on-road routes were higher than those of the standard driving cycles,
which means that the on-road routes included severe periods of acceleration. As a result,
on-road routes are expected to present higher values of exhaust emissions, especially for
NOx , which is considerably correlated to engine speed and load.

can be found in Table 4. Moreover, the standard drive cycle of the NEDC (New European
Driving Cycle) is included in Table 4. Comparing the kinematic parameters of real-world cycles with a standard driving cycle indicated that the RDE routes were more aggressive. A
standard drive cycle of NEDC was chosen for comparison with the RDE routes, since NEDC

for nearly 30% of global final energy use (a considerable amount) and 23% of total energy
sector direct CO2 emissions. Under this representation, transportation has a high share of
decarbonization, and the SDS aims to reach zero-carbon emissions, in the TTW assessment,
for passenger cars by 2070. The strategies proposed to reach this goal include biofuels,
hybridization of vehicles, and electrification of the transportation sector. Therefore, during
the transition to zero-carbon emissions, an increased trend in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and
electric vehicles is expected in the future. Similar trends are presented in the Net Zero
Emissions (NZE) scenario provided by the International Energy Agency in 2020 [42], where
the consumption by fuel type was predicted, and a great share of electricity in the transport
energy supply by 2050 was reported. Moreover, plug-in hybrid and electric-battery vehicles’
share in transportation is soaring, and it is envisaged that by 2050, electricity and hydrogenbased fuel vehicles will account for more than 70% of the transport energy demand.
Given the abovementioned expected scenarios, future research directions may include
the analysis and comparison of the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) of hybrid, plug-in
hybrid, and electric-battery vehicles to estimate the total CO2 emissions associated with the
transition from conventional to e-mobility.
The LCA analysis should be then combined with a cost/benefit analysis of harnessing
renewable energy sources in positive energy districts for e-vehicle charging stations and
the related infrastructure to provide key stakeholders with a holistic perspective on the
potential benefits and impact of e-mobility in the context of PEDs.
5. Conclusions
In this study, the preliminary results, which are presented in [43], of two hybrid vehicles and six conventional vehicles were inspected using the portable emission measurement
system (PEMS) for their fuel consumption and emission factor behaviors in real-world driving conditions over four different routes including urban and highway routes. It was found
that hybrid vehicles were significantly beneficial in CO2 and fuel consumption mitigation
by up to 50%, especially in urban driving cycles, which can be a tremendous advantage
for utilization in positive energy districts as a bridge to e-mobility and battery electric
vehicles. Moreover, the micro-trip analysis showed that hybrid vehicles emitted lower CO2
values in urban conditions due to the operation of the electric motors and utilization of
regenerative braking energy. Future studies can inspect LCA and upstream emissions in
HEVs as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles while considering their load on the grid.
Furthermore, harnessing renewable energy sources in the district for EV charging stations
and the related infrastructure is a topic of interest, particularly in view of the transition
towards the integration of fully electric mobility in positive energy districts.
