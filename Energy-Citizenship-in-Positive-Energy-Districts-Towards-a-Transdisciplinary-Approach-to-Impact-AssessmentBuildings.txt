Abstract: It is commonly assumed by the projects demonstrating concepts for positive energy districts
in cities across Europe that citizens want and need to be involved in the development of these concepts
as an essential condition for positive energy districts to be deployed successfully and to achieve
the expected societal goals. Six different research and innovation projects are investigating the
different forms of energy citizenship in positive energy districts and their impacts. They aim to
apply a transdisciplinary approach to collaborative research and to impact assessment. The interim
results are described, and preliminary conclusions on impact are drawn. The projects each used
different approaches to engaging citizens, while differentiating between different groups. Progress
is monitored but only fragmentary evidence on the impact has been gathered. Transdisciplinary
approaches are being developed but are still immature.

1. Introduction
The involvement of citizens and energy communities is seen as a key pillar of the
energy transition process [1–9]. Citizens interact with the technical energy systems, since
they are both the subject and object of social innovation in the energy society, and they are
emerging economic actors in the energy markets. To design and optimise fair, inclusive,
and just energy transition pathways, it is a requirement to have suitable policy making,
good collaborations between stakeholders, realistic business models, and citizens who play
an active role in shaping and accelerating the socio-technological energy transition [10,11].
The role of citizens and citizen organisations in both driving and facilitating the energy
transition towards climate neutrality and inclusivity has gained much attention among
scientists, local policy makers, and the private sector. It is in this context where the notion
of “energy citizenship” arises, as a placeholder for new social roles and responsibilities
for citizens in an energy system in constant transformation [2–6,12]. The term energy

citizenship represents the active participation of citizens in the energy system—such as
adopting renewable technologies, joining energy communities, supporting local initiatives,
and participating in policy decision-making [13] and in the energy economy in their multiple roles as users, protesters, supporters or prosumers, and involving energy consciousness
and literacy as well as sustainable energy practices [8,14]. It concerns both the actions of
individual citizens and collective citizens’ initiatives and organisations.
In the energy transition, decentralisation towards local technological (energy system)
and local economic systems is being explored increasingly, which could potentially offer
important synergies with local social innovation initiatives in the city. More concretely,
the model of energy-positive districts (PED), which enhances decentralisation, aims to
capture the benefit of local energy system, economic and social innovations [15]. Through
engaging and facilitating citizen participation, the role of the citizen transforms from a
passive consumer to an active participant in the transition as, for example, the initiator of
new, local, energy initiatives, by becoming a member of such an initiative or by changing
role from consumer to prosumer or by contributing to scientific research and monitoring
processes [16].
This paper presents and discusses the methods, strategies, and expected impacts for
citizen engagement applied in six different European research and innovation projects in
Positive Energy Districts, focusing on their research approaches and the observed impacts.
Through this multiple project view, this paper (1) assesses the progress towards a transdisciplinary research approach and methodology focused on impact assessment, (2) reflects
this approach towards ongoing research and innovation (R&I) projects on positive energy
districts, where energy citizenship aims to co-drive the technological, economic and social
innovations, and (3) explores conclusions on the potential and limitations of energy citizenship in the energy transition and developing policy recommendations in strengthening
energy citizenship.
The following three research and innovation questions are addressed:
1.
2.
3.

How can citizens potentially engage in positive energy districts and thus contribute
to the societal objectives of PEDs?
What is the interest in, acceptance and uptake of citizens of these options to engage in
the energy systems of positive energy districts?
What impact from citizen engagement is observed and validated already in the
ongoing demonstration projects of positive energy districts?

In addition, we address the added value of transdisciplinary research in answering
these questions and explore how much progress has been made in the projects so far in
applying transdisciplinary research methodologies and approaches. This paper presents
considerations towards a methodological framework for transdisciplinarity in impact
assessment on energy communities in PEDs. The current practice is illustrated for ongoing
PED R&I projects. Finally, recommendations are given to speed up the progress towards
transdisciplinarity in PED-related R&I projects.
2. Positive Energy Districts as an Instrument in Urban Energy Transition
PEDs are a new concept for energy planning at neighbourhood and city scale. They
consist of delimited areas of buildings, public spaces, and infrastructure that together create
a total positive annual energy balance, meaning that the area will deliver, on average, an
energy surplus to be shared with its surrounding urban or peri-urban areas.
PEDs are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban areas or groups of connected
buildings which produce net zero greenhouse gas emissions and actively manage an
annual local or regional surplus production of renewable energy. They require integration
of different systems and infrastructures and interaction between buildings, the users and
the regional energy, mobility, and ICT systems, while securing the energy supply and
a good life for all in line with social, economic and environmental sustainability [15,17]
(Figure 1).

From a research and innovation perspective, the holistic approach to PEDs poses a
particular challenge:

•

•
•

The innovations and measures that collectively establish and comprise a PED cover
different domains, ranging from the installation of batteries for energy storage to
motivating residents to establish an energy community.
The societal objectives also cover different policy domains, as shown in the table.
Finally, the impact pathways that link innovations and measures to the societal impacts
they aim to achieve is complex: technical innovations have an impact on economic
and social impacts; social measures have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and
energy efficiency.

As a result, the challenge of research and innovation projects is to identify, pilot and
evaluate the impact of citizen engagement through energy citizenship, in its different forms,
working towards societal impact across the societal goals, considering the synergies and
trade-offs with the other non-social PED components and innovations.
3. The different Modes of Energy Citizenship in PEDs
The projects demonstrating the PED concept in cities across Europe assume that
citizens should want and need to be involved in these new energy concepts, so they are
successfully deployed in the long term. However, further research is needed to understand
in what ways and in what roles can citizens be engaged in PEDs [22]. This section explores
the different modes of energy citizenship.
3.1. Individual Citizenship
Energy citizenship can be expressed through the engagement of individuals or households. This includes purchasing green energy, supporting/engaging in energy retrofits,
engaging in sustainable lifestyles, and actively participating in PED design and operation.
A hypothesis is that living in a PED district will motivate residents towards behavioural
changes, e.g., in the ATELIER project [23]. Behavioural change is both a strategy for citizen
engagement and an expected outcome of citizen engagement.
3.2. Local Energy Initiatives
Citizens can also engage with the energy system through collective initiatives. This
can range from taking part in non-formalised groups that motivate neighbours towards
energy savings, to becoming active market entities as part of local energy initiatives (LEIs).
These are communities of households who self-organise to meet their energy demand with
locally produced green energy, as a well as promoting energy savings [24].
3.3. Energy Citizenship through Local Energy Communities
Through the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, the EU has introduced the
concept of energy communities in its legislation, notably as citizen energy communities
and renewable energy communities [25]. The Directive on common rules for the internal
electricity market includes new rules that enable active consumer participation, individually
or through citizen energy communities, in all markets, either by generating, consuming,

Research on energy participation has shown the importance of multidisciplinary
approaches [37–39]. For example, Romero et al. [40] demonstrated the contribution of
applying Mixed Method research [41] in generating rich data on buildings’ occupants’
subjective value when managing their energy consumption. By combining motivational
(e.g., Self-Determination Theory in work environments [42], in situ occupancy monitoring [43–45] and interaction design methods, holistic knowledge has been generated. This
knowledge aims to describe and explain occupants’ behaviour towards energy management. It provides a holistic understanding of what drives occupants to manage their energy
and how the practice of managing can be optimised to reach a higher and more active
involvement.
Interdisciplinary research integrates knowledge and methods from different disciplines, using a real synthesis of approaches. Interdisciplinarity is a process of answering
a question, solving a problem, or addressing a topic that is too broad or complex to be
dealt with adequately by a single discipline or profession. Interdisciplinarity studies draw
on disciplinary perspectives and integrate their insights through construction of a more
comprehensive perspective. One of the biggest challenges in interdisciplinary research is
achieving effective communication between experts from different disciplines in order to
create a level playing field amongst (project) participants and be able to let them confront,
debate, and negotiate ideas and perspectives in order to facilitate sufficient integration
of knowledge [29,30]. Transdisciplinarity is a reflexive research approach that addresses
societal problems by means of interdisciplinary collaboration as well as the collaboration
between researchers and extra-scientific actors. Its aim is to enable mutual learning processes between science and society where integration is the main cognitive challenge of the
research process [46].
For the purpose of this paper, we adopt the definitions from the SHAPE-ID project on
shaping inter- and transdisciplinary research practices in Europe, as this project is based
on a recent mapping and scanning of both literature and practices, consolidated with
consultations of a broad range of practitioners (Table 2) [47,48].

4.1. The Need for Transdisciplinary Research in PEDs
In research and innovation (R&I) projects in climate neutral, smart, and inclusive cities,
the perspective and role of citizens is being increasingly recognised and addressed. For the
Smart Cities and Communities Programme under Horizon 2020, which funded several of
the project presented as case studies in this paper, the objective of R&I projects is described
as bringing together research, cities, industry and citizens to demonstrate solutions and
business models that can be scaled up and replicated, and that lead to measurable benefits
in energy and resource efficiency, new markets and new jobs. R&I projects are always
structured around demonstration projects. The question that arises is how applied research
can support the design and implementation of effective policies and actions of public and

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

non-public stakeholders for energy citizenship to have the maximum contribution to the
range of public/societal goals.
Speeding up the energy transition requires an encompassing approach that needs
to bring together social, economic, and technical aspects. Therefore, most current R&I
projects are emphasising the need to move from multidisciplinarity (people from different disciplines working together, each drawing on their disciplinary knowledge) to
interdisciplinarity (integrating knowledge and methods from different disciplines, using
a real synthesis of approaches). In the area of energy citizenship, the involvement of
non-academics in research is important, thus requiring transdisciplinary approaches.
Energy-positive districts (PED) can be achieved through the integration of technical,
economic and community-level social innovation. One of these innovations, collective
energy citizenship through local energy communities, could potentially contribute to
environmental, economic, and social objectives, of which climate change mitigation has
the highest priority. These communities could facilitate local energy system optimisation,
raise private capital for renewable energy, and promote sustainable behaviour. The exante and ex-post assessment of these impacts is crucial to the selection and design of
communities’ models and for deciding on the role of this innovation in urban energy and
climate mitigation policies [34–36].
This impact research requires a transdisciplinary approach, which intends to transgress
boundaries between disciplinary knowledge; integrate different bodies of knowledge and
create new knowledge; develop new interdisciplinary research methods; and imply active
co-creation of knowledge between academic and societal partners:
1.

3.

The promotion of energy citizenship in PEDs could have an impact on the social,
economic, energy and environmental societal goals.
The promotion of energy citizenship comprises a range of measures from social
interventions, such as providing information and motivation; technical measures,
such as providing the ICT platform for trading, and the interfaces between residents
and the energy systems; and economic incentives (pricing).
The impact of intervention along the impact pathways should imply many interlinkages and dependencies between the domains and disciplines.

4.2. How to Assess the Progress towards Transdisciplinarity?
In current practice in R&I in the area of energy transition, research is still multidisciplinary, involving separate disciplinary approaches around a common interest, working in
a self-contained manner and with little cross fertilisation (“integration”) among disciplines
or synergy in the research outcomes.
The next question is how to assess and evaluate ongoing R&I projects on the progress
towards an inter- and transdisciplinary research. The starting point is to “promote problemdriven interdisciplinary research, prioritising the scientific problems behind the energy
transition instead of disciplinary preoccupations” [48]. The following is a tentative list of
areas for evaluation on the progress towards transdisciplinarity. This framework is the
basis of the evaluation framework of the case studies presented in the following section.

5. Case Studies of Six European Smart City Projects
This section presents six case studies of R&I projects, which together illustrate a set
of multiple different approaches to researching the models of energy citizenship in PEDs
and the evaluation of impact, and varying approaches to interdisciplinary research. Four
projects are focused on PEDs (ATELIER, +CityxChange, MAKING-CITY, and POCITYF).
The project MySMARTlife, though not focused on PEDs, addresses the same set of innovations. They are all part of the EU’s Smart Cities and Community Programme. Finally,
ENERGE addresses education as a key intervention for energy citizenship.
5.1. Amsterdam Bilbao Citizen-Driven Smart Cities (ATELIER)
ATELIER is an EU-funded Smart City project aiming to create and replicate Positive
Energy Districts within two lighthouse cities, Amsterdam and Bilbao, and six fellow
cities [23]. Co-creation, citizens’ energy communities, and behavioural change are the main
strategies for citizen engagement. The project, with a duration of 5 years, is currently in its
third year. In this phase, the project’s approach and detailed activities are being designed
and tested. Ongoing activities include collaboration with existing energy communities in
the district that serve as testing grounds and to establish so-called Innovation Ateliers that
serve as a multi-stakeholder platform, addressing upscaling of specific PED innovations.
ATELIER as a research and innovation project is similar to +CityxChange, POCITYF
and MAKING-CITY in the high-level objectives for the role of citizens in the project. Cocreation, citizens’ energy communities, and behavioural change are the main strategies.
The concept of energy citizenship is not yet introduced explicitly in ATELIER. The PED
demonstration in Amsterdam has commenced construction. This is supported by increased
exchange and cooperation with other ongoing projects, and an internal interim evaluation
process. Ongoing activities include [23,49]:

•

•

•

Collaborating with previously established energy communities in the district that
serve as testing grounds and as inspiration for the new larger scale communities that
will be established in the Amsterdam demonstration.
Establishing so-called Innovation Ateliers that serve as a multi-stakeholder platform
addressing issues coming up amongst the stakeholders during the innovation project,
as well as upscaling of specific PED innovations, such as energy communities.
Organising artistic interventions and low-threshold activities with residents in the
area related to energy transition, in cooperation with local organisations. The activities
are expected to offer the possibility to learn about (more) community initiatives in the
energy transition and learn about preferred participation roles of various actors. Some
activities had to be cancelled due to the pandemic.
The preliminary findings are:

•

•

The main components of the Amsterdam PED demo are two new developments
(blocks of buildings) as well as an established smaller community. This implies for
the new developments that the future inhabitants were not directly involved in the
design of the buildings. The scope for co-creation and citizens’ energy communities is
therefore limited to specific components of the PEDs only.
The work package structure, with a separate WP for citizen engagement and a separate
one for the demonstration projects, is common for this kind of R&I project. However,
this structure hampers breaking the silos towards multidisciplinary work methods, as
cross-cutting activities are not core business. A common research methodology across
disciplines is still under development, allowing an interdisciplinary way of working.

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

•

•

•

•

There is a need for a common vision across project partners and involved stakeholders,
who are predicted to be impacted by energy citizenship as a hypothesis. For example,
will energy citizenship contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as well
as to social objectives?
Related to this is the need to map the impact pathways starting from the project’s
interventions to the desired impact. This will help to identify synergies and trade-offs
between different targets. To this purpose, the Innovation Ateliers will address energy
communities, and a Theory of Change is being developed.
The citizens and future inhabitants of the Amsterdam PED are primarily higher
income. Upscaling and replication of PEDs in Amsterdam requires the transition to
other demographics in the city. The methodology for assessing the different impacts
and the interventions is still under development.
The resident’s willingness to participate in community level and peer2peer trading
may be low, due to lack of clarity on conditions and risks, among other reasons.

In the area of energy citizenship, the impact research is still primarily multidisciplinary.
The concept as well as the focus of the expected societal goals are very dependent on the
framing by the disciplines and individual researchers. Additionally, a transdisciplinary
approach, involving citizens in the research activity itself, still needs to be established.
5.2. +CityxChange: Positive City Exchange
Within +CityxChange, the lighthouse cities Trondheim (Norway) and Limerick (Ireland) are developing demonstration projects in climate-friendly and sustainable urban
environments towards Positive Energy Blocks and Districts [29]. They are understood as a
way to increase and integrate local renewables in an approach driven by cities, citizens, and
stakeholders as part of the local energy transition. +CityxChange places particular emphasis on the role of citizens as co-innovators—explorers, ideators, designers and diffusers—in
the co-creation and replication of Positive Energy Blocks and Districts [29,50]. Main demos
towards this are six interconnected CommunityxChange solutions which can operate as an
integrated toolkit, focusing on citizen empowerment through measures including citizen
observatories in the form of innovation labs and activation of the local innovation ecosystems through innovation playgrounds [51], together forming an urban living lab approach
(Figure 4); implementation of open calls for citizen solutions; a Positive Energy Champion
Network; and investment and engagement activities to enable citizens to invest in their
own buildings for efficiency measures and local energy generation.
The work is informed by Arnstein’s ladder of participation [52], the transtheoretical
model of behaviour change [53], and is placed within an overarching framework of Open
Innovation 2.0 [54] and Quadruple Helix collaboration [55]. A specific focus lies on process
innovation and social innovation aspects.
The project aims at multilevel impacts, ranging from individual engagement measures,
events, or labs, up to strategic alignment of cities and overhauling city transition processes.
Preliminary insights gained so far, which will be further validated, include [56–58]:

•
•

•
•
•
•

Cities use different governance process partnership models, and physical solutions to
implement PEDs, dependent on local context.
Non-technical factors such as streamlining, organisational relationships, funding
approaches and stakeholder engagement are crucial for complex projects such as
this one.
Understanding and working with regulatory barriers on energy trading is vital [59,60].
Designing, implementing, and managing PEDs needs ongoing monitoring, evaluation,
mitigation, and adaptation, based on what is learnt during the activities.
Initial stakeholder mapping for project development should be revisited and refined
as the PED matures.
Reanalysis of technical feasibility in areas and buildings for specific measures
is necessary.

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

•

With the right stakeholders involved and suitable local and political anchoring, adaptations and pivoting are possible (for example regarding COVID-19 impacts), and
may ultimately strengthen stress-tested solutions. While initially defined (technical)
impacts may have to be reduced, resilience and replicability may be increased.
•
Financial costs are still one of the significant barriers to scaling.
•
Complex projects in cities can benefit from a portfolio approach addressing a range of
contexts and linked with the EU Cities Missions.
•
The citizen role of co-innovator has been adopted by the project in activities such
as citizen labs, innovation playgrounds, and hackathons. In the Positive Energy
Champion Campaign, citizens were observed to migrate across various co-innovator
roles and themes when developing and implementing their individual step-by-step
plans for change [61].
•
Citizens engaged to date demonstrate a strong commitment to the clean energy transition but can feel disempowered by the need for systemic change.
•
We cannot make this only the responsibility of citizens. A fair distribution of risks and
Buildings 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW benefits between citizens and professional stakeholders is important.

•
Societal benefits as a societal mission should be linked with climate action.

solution and at a later stage in the design and execution of energy efficiency interventions,
using their schools as living labs.
The project has analysed the education governance structures in Europe in general and
in the six pilot countries specifically, to investigate the decision-making power of secondary
schools in Europe. Whilst around a third of European countries grant a high degree of
autonomy to schools for managing financial and human resources, in a small group of
countries—Germany, Greece, France (primary education), Cyprus, Luxembourg (primary
education), Malta and Turkey—schools have very limited or no freedom in this area [63]. In
general, schools have more autonomy on operational expenses than on capital expenditures.

The presented knowledge has been used as input for the first intervention to be deployed at all schools. The intervention aims to explore and define the role of energy and

The Liker, is aware of the impact of the climate change, but prefers to stay modest
with his/her options. This group want to be cool and be liked by their peers. Being an
anonymous/low-key contributor is acceptable but speaking up is way too nerdy.
The Lurker represents the majority of the students, who do not want to share or do not
know sharing his or her opinion can make a difference. This group is a bigger fan of social
media than our planet.
The School Educator represents the teacher who is fully dedicated in the educational
obligations and has little time for tasks beyond. Practicability and efficiency are the key.
The Life Educator is the teacher who is highly engaged in coordinating and promoting
the green actives at the school. They are passionate about passing on the knowledge of
sustainability to their students and colleagues. New tools and platforms related to the
climate are favoured by this group.
In general, students show little initiative in terms of actively engaging in changes,
due to reasons such as accepting the status quo and keeping a “cool image” of being
uninterested. However, there are also students showing interest for change yet not actively
engaging in it, and a smaller group of students who are actively involved while feeling the
need to involve others to make impactful changes. From teachers, the work pressure indicated the presence of two archetypes: one that focuses their teaching efforts on covering all
aspects in the educational curriculum, and one that explores ways to apply the knowledge
into societal issues, such as sustainability.
With regard to preferences, both teachers and students express the need to (a) generate
awareness and an evidence-based understanding of the implications of their school needs
and activities on energy use, and (b) generate a critical mass of actors in the school to be
effective in acting and making changes.
The presented knowledge has been used as input for the first intervention to be
deployed at all schools. The intervention aims to explore and define the role of energy and
comfort data visualisations and interactions, to increase awareness and activate students
and teachers. By means of interactive challenges, the intervention aims to help students
and teachers to identify relevant comfort and energy issues and understand their impact.
The first iteration of the intervention will focus on students’ and teachers’ engagement by
involving desired qualities such as, “fun”, “challenging” and “social”. In later iterations,
the focus will lie on (a) integrating knowledge generated by other partners in the project
in relation to teaching modules, energy strategies and social practices for change; and
(b) scaling up issues, actions and impact across ENERGE schools and ultimately to schools
outside ENERGE.
5.4. MAKING-CITY
MAKING-CITY aims to demonstrate the possibilities of the PED concept by implementing and/or replicating the findings of two lighthouse cities, Groningen and Oulu, in
six follower cities in Europe [65]. One of the main challenges for developing PED districts
is raising awareness among residents on the energy transition and relating this to the local
issues, such as climate adaptation, (e-)mobility and public green. In Oulu, an operational
model was adopted based on community “bridges” and forums that are publicly accessible,
whereas in Groningen, Unified Citizen Engagement Approach (UCEA) was developed,
which involves individuals, local initiatives, and the municipality.
Currently, the UCEA is being tested and evaluated in several neighbourhoods in
Groningen in collaboration with several local energy initiatives. The UCEA is an integrated
approach which combines the perspectives of the individual, the cooperative and the
municipality, suggesting pathways and interactions for each of the three actors in the
process. In accordance with the flexible nature of the citizen engagement process, it is
a dynamic and iterative model, suggesting tools and methods that could be utilised to
achieve certain milestones in energy transition. The key challenges are:

•

Building a solid foundation of community trust is essential for any type of intervention
to be supported by the neighbourhood. In Groningen, the erosion of trust in (local)

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

•
•
•

•

government due to the earthquakes in the region makes the community weary of
government interventions in their neighbourhoods.
Tenants stated that they are often not involved in meetings organised by local energy initiatives, because they are not applicable to their situation and/or it lacked a
personal approach.
Students are often afraid of possible reprisals by their landlords by bringing up issues
surrounding sustainability.
Shortage of (professional) manpower is a frequently occurring issue in local
energy initiatives.
Several stakeholder groups, such as (social housing) tenants, (international) students
and private landlords are seldom approached or addressed in energy-related activities
and campaigns.
Communication surrounding energy-related activities is often perceived to be insufficient, inefficient or (inadvertently) excludes certain groups of residents.

Furthermore, the lighthouse cities have developed a series of questionnaires and tools
with the aim of facilitating the co-creation of PED-designs in six follower cities (Leon, Spain;
Kadikoy, Turkey; Bassano del Grappa, Italy; Lublin, Poland; Trencin, Slovakia; Vidin,
Bulgaria). These modular questionnaires include a variety of topics relating to energy,
such as consumption, generation, efficiency and flexibility as well as questions pertaining
to mobility and social cohesion (development of local communities). The data from the
questionnaires will be utilised to construct potential indicators that will help the FWCs to
realise their own PEDs and encourage them to further develop City Visions 2050.
The objectives of the cities vary from one to another, depending on local community
development readiness in their respective contexts. Four of six FWCs would like to know
their citizens’ needs/vision for the city district, directly or indirectly related to energy. The
desired insights range from creating awareness about energy transition/needed measures,
to gathering opinions about measures/concepts, to insights into the needs/visions on
how to improve the living standards of citizens. Most of the FWCs have an overall
plan (e.g., SEAP, SECAP) and two of them have taken action to consult citizens on their
preferences in specific solutions. They have already utilised a few tools, such as hackathons,
workshops, webinars, ateliers, online surveys, online platforms, meetings, door-to-door
surveys, thematic games, debates, public consultations.
In addition, they would like to develop festivals, conferences and workshops in the city
as well as webinar platforms, mobile applications, educational materials and e-participation
and consultations. Most of the cities face barriers to realising citizen engagement activities.
These barriers need to be considered, as COVID-19 measures prohibit certain activities and
events. Furthermore, low awareness and low interest among citizens relating to the topic,
limited time, high costs, limited authorisation to act and difficulty to reach target groups
(e.g., elderly) can complicate matters further.
The barriers could be overcome by financial and technical support as well as subsidies
from public bodies and energy markets, by raising awareness and performing measures by
involving the local community, selecting the right platforms at the right time, conducting
training programs for certain stakeholders (on sharing information and to promote better
collaborations) and sharing information on renewable energy through open data platforms.
The initial recommendations for the citizens of FWCs are therefore as follows:

•

•
•

The Unified Citizen Engagement Approach incorporates different stakeholders and
provides insights into what to share and communicate and how to collaborate in each
phase of the transition of a neighbourhood.
This strategy also provides a good framework to recommend usage of specific measures, methods and tools in the different phases of the energy transition.
There are two main activities at the start of the energy transition: a social(-economic)
analysis with citizens and a technical analysis of the target neighbourhood. Citizen
engagement starts in this first phase.

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

A detailed analysis will be conducted soon to encourage FWCs in developing energy
communities to sustain the energy transition and PED implementations in the already
designed areas under the MAKING-CITY project.
5.5. mySMARTLife
The mySMARTLife project aims to make the three lighthouse cities of Nantes, Hamburg, and Helsinki more environmentally friendly by reducing the CO2 emissions of these
cities and increasing the use of renewable energy sources [66]. As part of an open innovation strategy to engage citizens to demonstrate the possibility of efficiently addressing
the energy transition issue whilst keeping high-quality living standards, mySMARTLife
explored the topic of raising social awareness and acceptance of change by developing key
factors that can help raise awareness for social acceptance and engage citizens directly in
the development of the transformation. The project involves citizens in the urban transformation, either as consumers/users or as city “planners”. The three lighthouse cities
have implemented interventions in the field of energy, mobility, and ICT, exploring the key
barriers these cities have encountered during the implementation phase and how they tried
to overcome them.
As part of this analysis, mySMARTLife explores the individual acceptance journey
for each intervention based on the process of design, delivery, and implementation of
each action and on who has influence in the acceptance journey (individual/household,
local community/town stakeholders and national/regional policies or stakeholders) at
which point of the implementation process. These influence levels were characterised
as miso (individual/household), meso (local community/town stakeholders) and macro
(national/regional policies and/or stakeholders) [67].
Based on these two categories, three types of acceptance journeys were developed: the
binary (inflexible), the semi-flexible and the flexible acceptance journey. By looking at each
of the individual case studies under the lens of the acceptance journey concept, it is advised
when actions should be taken towards whom so social acceptance can be leveraged in the
best possible way (intervention points or engagement points).
It is useful for all the actors in a smart city project to better understand the underlying
structure of their interventions and, through their understanding, adapt the process of
community engagement. This will allow for an increase in social acceptance.
One of the first lessons learnt is that by analysing the individual acceptance journey
for each intervention based on the phases of design, delivery, and implementation of each
action and on who has influence during the acceptance journey (individual/household,
local community/town stakeholders and national/regional policies or stakeholders), intervention points can clearly be defined.
If the increase in the level of influence that the user has will lead to an increase in
acceptance, as such it is important to include the user as early as possible in the design and
delivery phase of the interventions. It can also be demonstrated that this can be difficult
when it comes to large-scale infrastructure measures. There is a need across all smart city
projects to increase the influence of users at the town/community level and to allow users’
views and perceptions to exert an influence at national and regional levels. Users must be
heard and be able to influence interventions, in order to increase social acceptance [68].
5.6. POCITYF
POCITYF helps historical cities to become greener, smarter, and more liveable, while
respecting their cultural heritage, by implementing and testing Positive Energy Districts
in two lighthouse cities, Alkmaar and Evora, and six follower cities [69]. POCITYF brings
together technology providers, grid operators, policy makers, and local communities to
collectively work on integrated innovative solutions across the built environment, energy
infrastructure, and e-mobility. Building upon the Arnestein ladder [52] and an initial
qualitative study with stakeholders in the two lighthouse cities, a citizen engagement
strategy framework was developed. This framework supports the exploration of strategies

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

16 of 22

and initiatives to support citizens in evolving along their journey toward higher levels
of engagement with sustainable energy solutions, from the initial awareness and usage,
to more proactive activities such as sharing, co-designing and becoming ambassadors.
This framework has been iteratively used in iterative co-creation workshops with citizens,
lighthouse cities and fellow cities to gain feedback and develop tailored strategies to foster
citizen engagement. One of POCITYF’s key solutions is to have citizens become key
stakeholders in the decision-making process to incorporate a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy
trading platform. P2P energy trading empowers citizens to feel in control of their own
energy flexibility and to create economic value in a direct way. P2P energy trading could
also be leveraged to enhance a community’s social cohesion by stacking non-energy-related
services that have been identified as bringing added value to members and nudging people
to adjust their behaviour.
5.7. Synthesis of Case Studies
Synthesis topic 1. Scope of modalities for energy citizens addressed in the projects—
In what ways can citizens potentially engage in positive energy districts and thus contribute to the societal objectives of PEDs?
The six projects have different strategies for involving different citizens’ populations
in the design and implementation of PEDs, ranging from early stage involvement in the
role of “urban planners” in the mySMARTLife project, to citizens becoming active energy
traders in the POCITYF project, to citizens as co-innovators in +CityxChange. Promoting
citizen engagement is very much in the foreground of all the projects. Most projects regard
energy literacy as a key condition, as an understanding of the nature and role of energy
in the world and daily lives, accompanied by the ability to apply this understanding to
answer questions, solve problems, contribute to, or start initiatives, and make decisions.
Within the projects, the models of citizens’ involvement are often spread across work
packages, with engagement activities in a separate work package to the development of
local energy trading platforms. As a result, there could be a lack of consistent shared
vision across the different models for energy citizens. In particular, the model for energy
citizenship that is most often related to the development of PEDs—energy communities
operating the local energy systems and as energy market party—is not addressed by the
same research group as the group working on addressing engagement.
Synthesis topic 2. What is the interest in, acceptance and uptake of citizens of these
options to engage in the energy systems of positive energy districts?
Increasingly, across the projects, more insights are gained on the issue, which is
crucial to assuring any impact from citizenship in PEDs. Still, few examples are available
where citizens have been able to have a substantial impact on the design of PEDs, beyond
the legally required consultation procedures. This was the case in exceptional advanced
communities, which are not representative of other much larger citizen demographics that
need to be engaged in replication of PEDs to achieve a wide-reaching impact. In many
cases, property ownership is needed to participate in the energetic PED work with retrofits
or installations of renewables on buildings. Tenants or citizens from other areas have
limited options. Therefore, in many projects, for example +CityxChange, additional roles
are identified, for example citizens as co-innovators, engagement of those people working,
but not living in a PED area, as well as regulatory initiatives that would need to make it
easier for citizens to participate instead of only larger commercial or municipal actors.
It is necessary to differentiate between different (groups of) citizens, and their varying capacities for participation, which align to the “system world” of development and
planning in a variety of ways. It seems that some frontrunner groups of citizens with
higher social or financial capital are more interested in, and capable of, engaging in ways
that actually drive decisions in PED-development, whilst other residents mainly have
the option to engage in activities stimulating “energy-conscious” individual behaviour.
The mutual relationship between being a PED inhabitant and making lifestyle changes

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

towards sustainable behaviour is also still very much a subject of research and no results
are available yet.
The number of energy communities, particularly those developing local renewable
sources, is growing, as are the impacts of these communities. In the Netherlands,
100,000 people already participate in local renewable energy projects [70]. Whether PEDs
could become a new driver for building energy communities is not clear yet.
The development of local communities engaged in local peer2peer energy trading (P2P)
and flexibility trading and acting as an energy market party is, so far, mainly technologydriven (development of ICT platforms and interfaces). Its rationale is based on societal costs
and benefits (avoiding investment while improving resilience in the power infrastructure).
There is still little evidence that citizens are willing to engage in sufficient numbers, especially those citizens beyond the initial frontrunner communities. In this case, “sufficient”
means enough to ensure impact and viable business cases. In some cases, there appears
to be a reluctance, even amongst frontrunner groups, as benefits are not recognised as
outweighing the complexity and risks. Additionally, automatised approaches seem to be
preferred [34].
Finally, we observe that in all projects, much time for research and development is
needed in order to build the systems through which citizens can engage. This also applies
to the development of the simple interfaces allowing interaction without the need for expert
knowledge. It is difficult, therefore, to engage a representative group of citizens in these
R&D activities.
Synthesis topic 3. What real impact from citizen engagement is already observed
in the ongoing demonstration projects of positive energy districts?
In all projects, KPIs have been adopted on social impact and citizen engagement,
but there is much variety in how they are defined, ranging from KPIs related to the mere
number of events and participants, to KPIs on the progress made towards energy citizenship
in terms of the share of local energy trading in the ATELIER project [71], or the impact on
organisations that changed their energy behaviour in +CityxChange [72]. In most cases,
the focus of the reported results and lessons learned has been on the barriers and drivers
of citizen engagement, and not on the impacts that have been achieved so far, nor on the
validation of the impact pathways. At this stage, only fragmentary results are available,
for instance from the ATELIER project, where energy communities have been reluctant to
adopt local energy trading, which provides valuable insight into evaluating the potential
impact of this innovation [44]. The positive energy champion campaign of +CityxChange
(see Section 5) has seen some behaviour change, mainly on the non-energy aspects, though
also with initial changes around eMobility. It is noted that the projects referred to in this
paper are on average about halfway through the project duration, with the initial phase
focused on setting up the activities for citizen engagement. Results are expected to be seen
in the later phases of the project only.
Synthesis topic 4. Progress towards transdisciplinarity impact assessment
We evaluate the progress based on the seven criteria as proposed by the SHAPE-ID
project [30–32].
1.

2.

Level of common vocabulary/terminology among different disciplines (and nonacademic actors) and efforts made to reach a common “glossary” as a starting point
for the project. This remains, in many projects, a work in progress. For example,
in +CityxChange, a glossary was initially built separately in the energy and citizen
tasks, which then needed to be aligned through a longer process and has also since
been added to its website. In ATELIER, there is a difference in perspective on energy
citizenship from the technical, legal and sociological perspectives, which hampers a
common evaluation of impact.
Level of common vision across disciplines on PEDs and energy citizens as an object of
research, impact targets and pathways between research outcomes and impact. This
is still very much a work in progress in all projects.

6.

7.

Progress in development and application of shared research methodology and impact
assessment framework (impact pathways), complementing disciplinary approaches.
In most projects, assessment methods are still multidisciplinary and derived from
the separate disciplines. A challenge can be an actual deep evaluation of project
interventions and their impact dependencies to project goals.
Progress on qualitative and quantitative (interim) results on impact indicators towards
societal goals. The projects have adopted varied ways to measure the impact of their
citizen engagement interventions, in most cases on the basis of Key Performance
Indicators (KPI)-based tracking and performance evaluation. Significant differences
in the approaches to KPIs can be observed, which make cross-project comparison
very difficult.
Levels of citizens’ involvement in the design and implementation of research (beyond being the object of research). Many projects organise citizenship consultations,
but there are few examples that citizens have had an impact on the design of the
PED and the design of specific innovations. In the case of new construction, it is
impossible to involve the actual residents at the initial stages of the projects, as they
have not moved in yet. Similar effects apply in mainly industrial or commercial
areas, where engagement aims at users of the area, not residents, for example in a
+CityxChange demo.
Initial structure of the project proposal that might enable or constrain, even from
the beginning, inter and transdisciplinary approaches. The positioning of citizen
engagement activities in the design of the projects varies. Some projects have separate
work packages for citizen engagement, making it a mere isolated activity restricting
multidisciplinary approaches, where other projects integrate citizen engagement with
other, often more technical, activities during the project lifetime.
Evaluation of the project activities envisioned at proposal stage/first year of the
project to gain potential missing knowledge/experience in order to reach desirable
levels of inter- or transdisciplinarity (depending on what is desirable according to the
project goals).

All in all, the R&I projects on PEDs are still in the early phases of developing a
transdisciplinary approach to the impact assessment of energy citizenship towards the
societal goals. While the projects are working to develop and apply this approach within
each project’s lifetime, the results in terms of full transdisciplinary impact assessment may
be realised in the next generation of R&I projects’ PEDs.
6. Discussion and Recommendations
In this paper, we have explored the hypothesis that citizens’ engagement through
energy citizenship is a key driver towards the societal impact of the energy transition in
general, and in positive energy districts. Although there is a common understanding that
the active support and involvement of citizens in the design and implementation of new
collaborative energy concepts, such as PEDs, is necessary for the success of such concepts,
there is no hard evidence yet that supports this claim. Some promising approaches were
discussed in the case studies. Measuring the contribution or impact of citizen engagement
on the success of new energy concepts has proven to be difficult. We see that research
and innovation projects in this area are still at an early stage in developing approaches to
rigorous impact assessment.
One of the main difficulties is the transdisciplinary nature of the projects and the
combination of social, political, and technological interventions that are simultaneously
conducted which obscure the impact of a single intervention. Another difficulty is the
context-dependent nature of these solutions, which challenges the generalisation of rich yet
contextualised knowledge. The lack of a common methodology for assessing the impact of
energy citizenship hinders the direct comparison of the efficiency of strategies for citizen
engagement across projects or cities.

Buildings 2022, 12, 186

A systemic perspective that is sensitive to the contextual determinants of each project
should contribute to harmonising the measurement of citizen engagement activities and the
related KPIs across the six projects. This is considered a first step towards an understanding
of the role and importance of energy citizenship in the energy transition.
The following project approaches could be explored:
1.

2.
3.

4.
5.

Avoid project designs that are only based on disciplines, such as those with a separate
work package for social impact and citizen engagement, which hampers working
in cross-disciplinary teams. Work packages are better structured around specific
innovations or have strong integrations between the respective tasks and regular
feedback between topics.
Develop a shared theory of change and shared impact pathways on energy citizenship
across all project partners and disciplines.
Appoint so-called boundary spanners with the research team; individuals with multidisciplinary knowledge, who can speak more than one disciplinary language. They
can make the required links across the project.
Share and discuss the theory of change with the citizens. Do they share the
same vision?
Invite citizens to the table when designing the research agenda for impact assessment
and give citizens (or their representative) an active role in the research activities.

Finally, the authors recognise that the exchange and cooperation between R&I projects
that address energy citizenship and PEDs is essential to assembling the necessary evidence
on impact across the many modalities of citizen engagement, the broad spectrum of PED
designs and the different city contexts in which PEDs are located. In particular, this
exchange should collect and synthesise the emerging insights on impacts around specific
modalities for energy citizenships, such as individual behavioural change and collective
energy, building, mobility and societal engagement. Only collectively can we determine
how far energy citizenship could contribute to the energy transition.
