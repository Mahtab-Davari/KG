Abstract: As energy generation based on renewable resources does not always match energy
consumption profiles, Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) should embody energy flexibility technologies
to decrease possible negative impacts on existing grids due to, e.g., reverse power flows. As part of
the EU H2020 Smart Cities and Communities project POCITYF, the cities Alkmaar (NL) and Évora
(PT) aim to support the deployment and market uptake of such districts and in doing so demonstrate
innovative and integrated technologies to enable flexibility in the energy system. This paper addresses
implementation conditions for energy flexibility technologies that help cities to engender the expected
impact and ensure replication of these technologies to other sites. It aims to guide both urban planners
and technology solution providers through pitfalls and opportunities that can appear during the
design and implementation of PEDs. Taking this into consideration, the RUGGEDISED innovation
and implementation framework for smart city technology was taken as a starting point to describe
and analyze the experiences in Alkmaar and Évora.
Keywords: governance; energy flexibility; positive energy districts; sustainable energy;

1. Introduction
The need for cities to become more sustainable is high and several definitions of smart cities refer
to this need. A definition of a smart city is “a sustainable and efficient City with high Quality of life
that aims to address Urban challenges (improve mobility, optimize use of resources, improve Health
and safety, improve social development, support economic growth and participatory governance)
by application of ICT in its infrastructure and services, collaboration between its key stakeholders
(Citizens, Universities, Government, Industry), integration of its main domains (environment, mobility,
governance, community, industry, and services), and investment in Social capital” [1]. However,
retrofitting existing environments remains challenging [2]. Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) play an
important role in more liveable and sustainable future cities. PEDs are districts producing energy
from local and distributed renewable energy sources, presenting generation surplus over a specific
balance period (typically one year) that may be transferred to areas outside a PED’s boundaries [3].
One definition of PEDs by JPI Urban Europe (2019) refers explicitly to the active management of energy
flows: “PEDs are energy-efficient and energy-flexible urban areas or groups of connected buildings
which produce net zero greenhouse gas emissions and actively manage an annual local or regional
surplus production of renewable energy” [4].

The large deployment of distributed generation based on renewable energy (RE) can increase the
complexity of grid management and operation due to several factors (see, for instance, the impact of
reverse power flows on distribution transformer aging [5]. Increased energy flexibility in the existing
energy systems is therefore a crucial mechanism to delay costly and overdesigned adaptation of the grid
infrastructure itself [6]. In this context, technology can be of great help in linking resource efficiency
and flexibility in energy supply and demand with innovative, inclusive and more cost-effective services
for citizens and businesses. Such technologies can integrate infrastructures like smart grids that have
been piloted in several cities in FP7 and H2020 projects [7].
In Alkmaar (Netherlands) and Évora (Portugal), innovative and integrated technical solutions are
being implemented in order to support the deployment and market uptake of PEDs. This research
and the pilots in Alkmaar and Évora are being conducted within the EU H2020 Smart Cities and
Communities project POCITYF [8]. The project started in October 2019 and includes the demonstration
of solutions of a high technology readiness level (TRL ≥ 6) [9] for achieving flexible and efficient
use of electricity in contexts with different climatic conditions and regional characteristics (technical,
financial, social and legal). Alkmaar and Évora are proving grounds for innovative and integrated
technical solutions for buildings and districts in which energy management systems are implemented
to increase flexibility. Starting points are lessons learnt from pre-pilots at other sites, i.e., locations and
buildings where individual technologies have been implemented before. The second step, which is
dedicated to demonstration activities, combines technologies toward integrated systems at the building,
block and district levels in the areas of Alkmaar and Évora. The third step refers to replication of
these integrated systems in other selected areas of Alkmaar and Évora and in the six fellow cities:
Granada (Spain), Bari (Italy), Celje (Slovenia), Újpest in Budapest (Hungary), Ioannina (Greece) and
Hvidovre (Denmark).
Starting from the RUGGEDISED innovation and implementation framework developed in the
EU H2020 RUGGEDISED project [10], this paper addresses implementation conditions for energy
flexibility technologies in Alkmaar and Évora in order to support the achievement of expected impacts
and ensure replication of these technologies within and beyond POCITYF. The technologies under
consideration are ReFlex [11] for Alkmaar and flexibility control algorithms for Évora. Both aim
at exploiting the energy flexibility provided by the available controllable devices (e.g., batteries or
electric water heaters) at the building, block and district levels in order to achieve specific objectives
(e.g., improve matching between renewable generation and energy demand or decrease peak loads).
The RUGGEDISED innovation and implementation framework is an analytical tool that helps city
planners to assess important success factors in the implementation process of smart technologies well in
advance. This framework focusses on smart city technologies in a broader sense without concentrating
necessarily on energy flexibility technologies alone. Therefore, this paper aims to guide both urban
planners and technology solution providers through pitfalls and opportunities that can appear during
the design and implementation of a PED. It describes practical examples of implementation conditions
seen or experienced in Alkmaar and Évora (or that were missing). This can be used to describe valuable
lessons for the implementation of energy flexibility in future PEDs. This framework identifies both
the implementation conditions that were of relevance and influence in either case of the two cities,
and those conditions that did not play a role. In doing so, it provides insights in improving and
adjusting projects and shifts the focus on conditions that matter. This paper discusses the application
of the framework by presenting how it is being used in practice for the analysis of the implementation
of PEDs in Alkmaar and Évora.
2. Materials and Methods
The RUGGEDISED framework [10] can be used to assess the implementation process of smart city
projects and therefore “advises” what should be in place for successful implementation. In POCITYF,
records of progress on pre-pilots and foreseen demonstration activities in Alkmaar and Évora have
been taken, using questionnaires. These questionnaires focused on key technical components

Energies 2020, 13, 5811

and specifications of the innovative solutions, on the demonstration sites (considering specific
challenges related to the context), on problems and restrictions experienced and on lessons learnt
(e.g., technical improvements, energy savings or socioeconomic benefits). The project partners involved
with each innovative solution took care of the respective questionnaires. These project partners work
for different organizations, e.g., research institutes, governments, utilities and technology providers.
Despite common challenges, the cities of Alkmaar and Évora face city- and district-specific
challenges due to divergent geography, geology, demography, climate and socio-economic and cultural
characteristics. These characteristics mean that urban energy transition challenges are embarked
upon from different starting points and perspectives, thus enhancing the complementarity of the
POCITYF solutions. Évora represents South European cities, which generally show lower investments
on reducing the footprint of their households and business sector but can enjoy an abundant solar
potential. Alkmaar represents West European cities that are strongly dependent on gas for electricity
and heating.
In more detail, the RUGGEDISED framework provides a useful base for analyzing success factors
and hindering factors for the implementation of smart technologies. In POCITYF, innovative smart city
solutions are implemented in order to achieve PEDs. This framework (see Table 1) was consolidated in
the EU H2020 RUGGEDISED project and allows the analysis of suppressing and enhancing factors in
implementation processes of smart solutions. Such an analysis is beneficial in designing successful
implementation processes, in assessing the potential project impact and in selecting aspects that need
further consideration for successful implementation.

factors [10].

The framework distinguishes three levels of impact that are needed in order to think beyond
implementation of single solutions and consider the real impact of implementation, namely:
•

•

•

Impact Level 1 (Realization and output of smart solutions): the first level of impact considers a
single smart solution that is successfully implemented and delivers its output (it is an isolated
realization of a smart solution).
Impact Level 2 (Embedded outcomes of multiple smart solutions): A smart solution produces real
output if it is well-embedded in the existing context. At the second level of impact, multiple smart
solutions interact and produce outcomes because they are well-connected and efficiently work together.
Impact Level 3 (Upscaling and replication): The third impact level is city-level outcomes.
This occurs when smart solutions are taken beyond single projects and are successfully scaled-up
to create smart urban structures. Real impact is made when smart solutions are replicated to other
areas and projects with different contexts.

The implementation factors influencing the development of smart solutions are described
per impact level. A division is made between hardware, software and orgware implementation
factors. Hardware focuses on physical infrastructure topics such as energy storage, conversion and
savings. Software refers to ICT, data-related factors and applications. Hardware and software must
be supplemented with orgware, which refers to organizational and governance aspects such as
stakeholder management, institutional and organizational arrangements and innovation platforms.
Dividing impact levels and implementation factors in three categories allows for structuring the
different factors that influence projects in different stages. Some factors help or hinder the realization
and output of smart solutions, whilst others specifically impact the working together of multiple
solutions to realize embedded outcomes. The framework shows that the importance of orgware
implementation factors increases as the impact level rises. These orgware implementation factors,
in turn, affect the upscaling and replication of smart solutions.
3. Results
One of the objectives of the POCITYF project is to deploy and validate smart energy management
and storage solutions to optimize energy flows with the goal of maximizing self-consumption,
reducing grid stress and valorizing flexibility services. To that end, innovative solutions to be
demonstrated and replicated include several individual elements: e.g., low-temperature waste heat,
innovative short- and long-term storage solutions, such as hydrogen fuel cells or electrical vehicles (EVs)
coupled with stationary batteries, smart ICT solutions to interconnect the energy management system
at the household, building and district levels, the virtual power plant (VPP) concept, thermal grid
controllers or market-oriented building flexibility services.
Figure 1 illustrates how the individual elements corresponding to the various layers, from concrete,
device-specific to abstract, domain-specific, are stacked on top of each other and interact to bring about
the full implementation and impact of an integrated innovative solution. On the left side, the data and
control flow is bidirectional for the full stacked solution to perform as per design, while on the right
side, there is only sharing of information to gain insight into the system, evaluate different options and
decide for further optimization and improvement steps. The loop is closed by feeding these insights

Availability of multiple assets that may be a source of flexibility.
Consideration of the objective to apply solutions that expose and valorize
flexibility and potential alternatives.
Feasibility study of physical implementation (all components) as modeled
in silico.
The battery systems placed in residences are by default connected to a different
phase of the 3-phase grid than both the solar panels and household energy
usage. This originates from standards used in the installation sector. This means
that the battery system cannot be used effectively to balance energy within
the residence.
Technical readiness level of components must be improved in order to use
small-scale storage solutions (through VPP or vehicle-to-grid (V2G)) in a reliable
way to control vital infrastructure, especially in brown field situations.
Improvements in the European and international standards can ensure
compatibility of the components in all situations.
Potential network constraints due to excessive flexibility operation within the
system have been identified. Analysis of the implemented scenarios was carried
out in which each flexibility source was individually considered; it became clear
that they can be used for network congestion management up to a certain
limitation. It was concluded that operation of flexibility and the different
forecasting systems can also cause a congestion in the network which changes
the network operation. Next to this, aggregator strategies further impact the
network operation.
Considering each flexibility source in relation to network limitations, especially
taking into account balancing concerns and guarantee of supply.
Good understanding of the layout of the low-voltage (LV) grid is a prerequisite
for implementing smartification efficiently. Without these accurate data,
one cannot determine where to place the measurement equipment in the grid.
State estimation is needed in order to be able to draw conclusions about the
current situation of the grid.
VPP in trade mode at times might have a negative effect on grid balance given
the current pricing mechanism. There are instances where energy is sold,
and thus delivered to the grid, during moments of local energy generation.
This can increase the peak load on the low-voltage grid in the districts.
By using the VPP for energy trading, based on forecasts of energy consumption,
PV generation, the energy prices on the trading market and the availability of
the battery, overall energy costs can be decreased. A low density of VPP
contributors in the LV grid (less than 5% of residences were equipped with
battery systems) showed little impact on the grid. The density of the VPP
contributors should be increased to notice the effect on the grid and to have
accurate predictability of average household behavior.
The distribution system operator (DSO) can alleviate peak loads on the grid by
using small storage (battery) systems. These batteries need to be operated in an
inherently grid-supporting mode, and peak load shaving requires fast and
reliable control mechanisms. From a business perspective, adequate financial
stimuli are needed. The DSO should have a mandate to overrule the settings of
the VPP to ensure grid stability and prevent a power outage.

reliable internet connection to function and during the City-zen project,
problems with the hardware were encountered frequently.
The reliability of OT/IT connections through 4G and Wi-Fi communication
networks used for VPP and V2G applications is lower than that of the grid itself.
The reliability needs to increase to match the reliability of the grid before a VPP
or V2G can be used as part of the vital infrastructure balancing loads on the
LV grid.

ReFlex is compatible with several open smart grid standards such as EFI/S2,
USEF and OCPI and is easy to implement in an aggregator’s existing
architecture. Still, bidirectional translation of asset protocols to EFI is a
necessary configuration step to enable reliable communication.
Reliance on standards instead of proprietary protocols to allow interoperability
is paramount.
The maturity of standards for interoperability is low; as such, in every single
project, protocols and interfaces need to be (re)determined between different
suppliers of technology.

Management and administration dashboards are included in ReFlex.

Local communities can become sustainable by being as self-proficient as possible
while monitoring energy use at the individual and district levels and using this
information for behavior change. The business district of Boekelemeer could
initiate a Citizen Energy Community (CEC) or a Renewable Energy Community

It is important that processes continue to be managed and it is essential that the
involved key figures remain available at crucial positions.
There was no technical supplier as a consortium partner or as official project
partner. It is recommended to seek active collaboration with a supplier of
technical components.

Innovation platforms

Important element to create a successful local innovation ecosystem is a
problem-solving environment providing structure and practices of innovation
management, training and tools as well as financial resources for innovation.
In Alkmaar, this has been initiated but from an external perspective not well
anchored in the city organization.

Conditions for upscaling:
finance, regulation (including
standardization), access to
information and social aspects

Market development:
•

•

Aggregator strategies can potentially greatly impact upon the energy system
since their objective of pursuing economic maximization of their assets may not
always align with optimization of operations for said assets; for example,
stationery batteries or EV operation may be masked by the aggregator whose
portfolio includes such assets by revealing only the worst case of the day instead
of their real-time state. Nonetheless, it also opens the door for other aggregators
to dive in with their flexibilities. This might result in a game theory problem
where in reality the aggregators would self-regulate themselves. Since there is
no flexibility market, the single aggregator in one network can act as
a monopolist.
Certain capabilities of both the VPP and V2G system cannot be utilized due to
regulatory barriers, sector standards or both. See also below.

Regulation and standardization:
•

•

Similarly, regulation must be adapted to enable better use of the current and
future electricity system possibilities such as use of flexibility and congestion
management. Due to current regulations and sector standards, certain
capabilities of both the VPP and V2G system cannot be utilized. Examples are
the use of the V2G system for emergency power and the self-consumption of
energy using the VPP by connecting the battery and solar panels of a household
to the same phase.
Implementation of a variable tariff system in the NL in which energy taxes are
coupled to the energy price and network tariff. Changing the Dutch taxation
tariff system can pave the way for using (local) flexibility and prevent more grid
reinvestments than necessary. This can be accomplished with, e.g., variable
network tariffs. Coupling the energy tax not to the energy amount but the price
of energy and network tariffs can have positive effects. Further research is
needed in order to determine which tariff system is best applicable.

Social aspects:
•

Finding and retaining participants for VPP and V2G projects is a
time-consuming task. Active participation and a substantial time investment are
required which is not always possible or desired. In addition, participants
sometimes move or retract from the project due to life events. The promoted
definitions of CEC and REC from the EU Green Energy Package can provide a
much-needed boost on this area.

Flexibility control algorithms were developed based on knowledge collected
during the participation on the working group “Annex 67” of the Energy in
Buildings and Communities (EBC) program from the International Energy
Agency (IEA).
The deployment of flexibility control algorithms has been considered to (i)
improve PV self-consumption and buildings’ self- sufficiency; (ii) explore the
existing energy flexibility available in water heaters to decrease electricity costs;
or (iii) characterize and use of the energy flexibility provided by water pumping
and storage systems to reduce electricity costs and support power systems.

•

Impact on energy grid

•
•

•

The impact related to the deployment of flexibility control algorithms on existing
grids should be considered before the respective real-world implementations.
This impact assessment should consider different scenarios (e.g., seasons of the
year) and can be conducted using simulation tools and specific information
about the grids under consideration.
The acquisition of information about the grids under consideration can be
challenging if the operator is not included in the process.

Besides the building level control of the available energy flexibility, flexibility
control algorithms can be used at district level to support the coordinated
operation of other technologies providing energy flexibility to achieve
building-level objectives while targeting improvements at the district level (e.g.,
peak load reduction).
The deployment of the flexibility control algorithms requires the interaction
with existing controllable devices to perform the required monitoring and
control activities. In POCITYF, this interaction will be supported by APIs made
available by the controllable device itself (e.g., direct interaction with energy
routers [14] or by other intermediate systems (e.g., indirect interaction with 2nd
life batteries through energy management systems).
Usage of standard protocols.

•

Dashboards will be provided by outside solutions that offer a graphical interface
for the users. Foreseen devices include: energy routers, 2nd life batteries,
electrical water heaters or freezing storage systems.

•

An assessment at district level should be carried out to define higher-level
objectives to be considered by the flexibility control algorithms in order to
support the achievement of a specific smart city vision.

4. Analysis
The RUGGEDISED framework allows for conducting an analysis of important implementation
conditions in the cities of Alkmaar and Évora. This section presents the respective main observations.
•

•

•

•

Energy flexibility management relies on both energy flexibility characterization and its respective
use. This means that the energy flexibility system is based on two main steps. First, it is necessary
to get insights (mainly related to flexibility characterization) on the flexibility usage potential and
application. Secondly, this flexibility potential will be applied while managing and controlling the
energy system.
Complex energy services like peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and VPP, management aggregation
services and an energy flexibility marketplace are built upon different individual components.
These lower layer(s) components must be functioning and deliver their output in order to provide,
possibly stacked, smart (energy) services. As such, Level 1 functioning of such individual
components is a prerequisite for smart energy services to exist and be deployed.
P2P platforms are deemed important from the abstract scenario perspective. However, development
mostly starts from a technical solution perspective, while end-user and other stakeholder
requirements are paramount in development. Citizen perspectives are often overlooked. Citizens
mostly experienced P2P as a burden or a complex, technical solution. According to Alkmaar’s
experience, relevant stakeholders were not interested, and they lacked knowledge and information,
while developers assumed citizens were eager for these technologies. Therefore, engaging all
stakeholders and especially end-users already from the conceptualization phase of energy flexibility
systems will benefit end-user satisfaction. To achieve this, it is important to bring developers
and end-users together so that requirements and needs of the local community are considered
and in the long term to ensure widespread and sustainable uptake. Most devices cannot provide
flexibility without the involvement of users. Therefore, they are crucial in generating flexibility in
energy systems. It is undeniable that the perspective of end-users is important in every phase from
conceptualization to development, deployment and operations.
Transition from Level 1 to Level 2 is normally funded by subsidies. However, subsidized projects
in which energy flexibility technologies are piloted have different timeframes that do not always
match with the daily business of industrial and business partners. Next to this, the research or
development objectives of subsidized energy projects do not per se align with business goals

(in time, budget and purpose). This results in the delivery of flexibility technologies that function
(Level 1) but will not necessarily graduate to achieve Level 2 and Level 3 impact; as such,
upscaling and replication are not induced. Single flexibility technologies are delivered but this
does not result in energy flexibility as a whole or flexibility in smart city systems. At the community
or neighbourhood level, subsidies are effective in reaching goals, but in order to achieve large-scale
impact (Level 2 and Level 3), combined strategies and widespread collaboration are needed.
Energy flexibility usage at higher levels should take into consideration the control objectives of
previous levels. This is the case when the energy flexibility of a specific device is being used at
Level 1 to, e.g., reduce electricity costs and then it is used to, e.g., reduce electricity consumption
CO2 -related emissions at Level 2. Therefore, the considered business models should properly
address the transition to upper limits in terms of objectives of energy flexibility use. Following the
previous comment, one can infer that each level may have different objectives which may not
only be disconnected from each other but also in some cases directly conflicting. Business models
need to be designed in order to address the different strategies that can be applied to the same
individual devices at different levels.
User engagement is key in exploiting the energy flexibility provided by several types of controllable
devices as the comfort needs should always be respected. Additionally, the characterization of
the energy flexibility provided by some devices (e.g., white appliances) might require the direct
user interaction to define the respective operation boundaries. This constitutes a constraint to be
considered at all levels.
It is of upmost importance to regard investments in flexibility usage as win–win situations.
For effective upscaling to take place, all involved stakeholders (e.g., DSO, municipalities, end-users)
must have a clear idea about the advantages of investing in flexibility.
There is no possibility to have accurate modeling without data, and data cannot be used if privacy
and security issues are not considered. Agile data management should be considered in order to
take the best profit from the considered technologies. A good example is the smart metering data,
where often end-users do not take advantage of their full potential.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, the RUGGEDISED framework was applied as the starting point to evaluate
the implementation conditions of energy flexibility solutions within the POCITYF project. Indeed,
the selected framework can be leveraged to provide a first analysis of both the success and hindering
factors for the implementation of smart technologies while taking a holistic approach that includes not
only technological perspectives but also organizational and systemic ones.
The main recommendations and findings for implementing energy flexibility-related technologies
at the PED level are summarized below.

Advanced innovative services and new business models, such as P2P trading and VPP, are quite
complex technologies and procedures. They can only be implemented at Level 1 if the individual
necessary components such as storage devices (for example, batteries) have passed Level 1.
Services like P2P can only be introduced when user needs have been considered and user
requirements are met. Therefore, involving end-users in the development of the services is key to
reach goals and ensure continuous uptake from a bigger group of clients. It is the developer’s
responsibility to consult end-users and the entire stakeholder value chain.
The two main functions of the energy flexibility system must be connected. Data insights will
have to feed back into the management and control process. The results of the control process will
have to be monitored and provide insight on the impact of the introduced control mechanism.
Without this feedback loop, the installed energy flexibility system will not be able to deliver the
potential optimal flexibility. Ergo, if there is impact, it is by coincidence and therefore it cannot be
sustained in the long term. Feedback can change the characterization and the use. A feedback

loop enables deeper understanding of the sources of error, that can either be found in the control
(use) or in the characterization function. For acceptance of energy flexibility, it is important to close
this loop. Insights delivered via tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed both on
rational arguments (economic and energy metrics) and on perception arguments (e.g., satisfaction
of citizens).
A legal framework will have to be updated to realize the full-scale potential of flexibility, because the
current legal framework does not allow for using and implementing flexibility. We may apply it
as a local, pilot-based tool. However, if one wishes to exploit its potential in full, a consistent and
encompassing legal framework is necessary.
In order to implement energy flexibility systems in the built environment and to eventually scale
up at district and city levels, gaps between daily practice and subsidized projects should be closed.
Goals of all partners must coincide with the aims of pilot projects. This is crucial for realizing
Level 3 outcomes but also for Level 2.
The absence of an adequate legal framework is a very important issue and not only for specific
energy flexibility technologies. Systemic hiccups introduced by a lack of appropriate or mature
legal instruments should be overcome beyond pilot project boundaries which in any case are
funded by subsidies whose power to influence directly relevant legislation is limited (both in
scope and time).

The experiences of Alkmaar and Évora result in an easy-to-use methodology for cities to deal
with energy flexibility technologies and create optimal conditions for their successful implementation
and integration. In the coming period, demonstration of the related energy flexibility technologies is
being carried out in both cities at the block and district levels. Starting from the analysis, progress is
to be tracked especially focused on achieving Level 1 and moving forward to higher impact levels.
This effort will also support the replication process not only in other areas within Alkmaar and Évora
but also the so-called “fellow” cities participating in the POCITYF project.
6. Practitioners Review by Roel Massink MSc
The authors of this paper asked me to provide my view on the methods and results of this
research paper in my capacity as Project Coordinator for the H2020 Smart City Lighthouse project
IRIS and innovation manager for the Municipality of Utrecht. I am happy to fulfil this task and
I thank the authors for the carefully presented research results based on actual demonstration.
This review is based on the experiences collected in the IRIS Smart Cities project, a similar project
to RUGGEDISED and POCITYF. In IRIS, an integrated project approach is demonstrated: in the
Kanaleneiland district (Utrecht, The Netherlands), near zero-energy-efficient building retrofitting is
connected to the development of a smart energy and mobility system integrating PV panels with
stationary and V2G storage. The smart solutions in IRIS Smart Cities Utrecht mostly all fall within
Level 2 of the RUGGEDISED implementation framework. Below, some general reflections based on
these experiences toward the RUGGEDISED implementation framework and the conclusions of the
paper can be found.
The structure of the RUGGEDISED framework is very much in line with what is happening
in practice in the IRIS Smart Cities project and further development of the framework in practice is
appreciated. Within the IRIS Smart Cities project, the smart solutions are implemented along transition
tracks and structured through a maturity assessment in the following categories: (1) pre-pilots:
solutions that have been tested on a small scale in a pilot project; (2) integrated solutions: multiple smart
solutions that are demonstrated as integrated solutions at a larger scale at the demonstration site of the
project; and (3) replicated solutions: through either the copying of a successful integrated solution to
other sites or by upscaling of the integrated solution in the same city or region. This categorization
provides the IRIS partners and stakeholders a framework and a roadmap for all smart solutions to
be developed, demonstrated and scaled-up. The RUGGEDISED framework is valuable and will

Energies 2020, 13, 5811

offer practitioners at public authorities, grid operators, solution providers and knowledge institutes a
coherent overview of what is important for implementation. However, below I have some suggestions in
view of the practical applicability of the RUGGEDISED framework. First, smart solutions are integrated
solutions by nature. To ensure that the smart solutions (that are realized in isolation; Impact Level
1) meet the requirements of an embedded outcome of multiple smart solutions (Impact Level 2),
it is suggested that an integrated approach with all implementation factors is taken into account.
To ensure such an integrated (and systemic) assessment throughout the development of smart solutions,
an iterative execution of the implementation framework could be proposed. This means that at Level 1,
the implementation factors of Level 2 and Level 3 are also considered. Assessment of implementation
factors in Level 2 and Level 3 includes more detailed and specific information once the development of
smart solutions progresses.
The following three reflections are supportive of including higher-level implementation factors at
the start of the pilot projects.
The paper highlights the importance of aligning partner goals with pilot project aims. This should
be seen as a conditional factor for achieving progress at the different impact levels. An example
from IRIS Smart Cities Utrecht is the development of a bidirectional charging ecosystem for grid
flexibility and mobility services. Currently, this integrated solution consists of multiple smart solutions
(bidirectional charging infrastructure, bidirectional enabled electric vehicles, stationary battery storage,
energy management system) that are being connected to provide embedded outcomes (Level 2).
The current state of development is a result of careful stakeholder management from the start of
the pilot projects (already pre-IRIS). Companies, knowledge institutes, grid operators and public
authorities aligned their roadmaps and activities in pilot projects under the lead of an ambitious SME
(Level 1) and now this is leading to embedded outcomes in the IRIS demonstration project (Level 2).
Furthermore, scaled adoption in public procurement documents of electric charging infrastructure
now paves the way for city-wide flexibility services of electric vehicles (Level 3). An important success
factor was/is stakeholder alignment from the start of the pilot projects. Based on this experience, it is
argued that stakeholder management (or rather stakeholder alignment) should take position already
at Level 1 to ensure that partner roadmaps are aligned to move the smart solution to Level 2 and 3.
The paper also points towards the requirement of end-user involvement (or co-creation) in the
development of smart solutions and could argue for the inclusion of a new implementation factor
in the RUGGEDISED framework. This could be “end-user satisfaction” or similar. This is a valid
point; often smart solutions are hampered because end-user needs were not considered well enough in
the original approach. A design-thinking (or another systemic) approach could offer smart solution
developers tools to better involve end-users. A practical notion that requires attention here is the use
of grant subsidies in this innovation framework (as the authors also refer to in moving from Level
1 to Level 2). It is recommended that subsidy programs, grant applicants and consortia put more
attention into making end-user involvement more explicit in call texts and subsequently also allow
more flexibility in the implementation of the grant project based on changes offered by end-users.
Next to this, the paper explains the requirement of a legal framework that supports the
transition from pilot projects to scaled solutions. This is true as well for the IRIS Smart Cities
project. Especially within the field of smart energy projects or services like peer-to-peer, a supportive
legal framework is needed for scaled adoption. The exploitation of grid flexibility services is hampered
by legal constraints. Research from the IRIS project shows that bidirectional charging services are
discouraged because of double energy taxation (for each charging and discharging cycle, energy tax
needs to be paid on either the stored or consumed kWh). This significantly hampers the realization
of profitable business models and commercial scaling of these integrated smart solutions. Therefore,
it could be argued that regulation/the legal framework is already introduced as an implementation
factor in Level 2 of the framework to ensure that, in time, legal constraints are targeted in a concerted
action by smart cities.

Finally, what the paper does not explain but what is highly valuable for practitioners is guidance on
how the implementation framework leads into an implementation process. The presented implementation
framework provides an assessment of implementation factors related to smart solutions but does not
directly translate the assessment into implementation guidelines. Further guidance on the implementation
pathway resulting from the assessment could support practitioners in applying this framework more easily.
