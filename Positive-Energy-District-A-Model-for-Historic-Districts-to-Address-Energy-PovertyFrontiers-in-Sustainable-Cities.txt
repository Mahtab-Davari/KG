Executive Summary
The EU’s SET Plan has proposed the development of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) to achieve the
transition towards a more sustainable energy system through the adoption of renewable energy
technologies and energy efficiency measures. PEDs are envisioned to be neighbourhoods that utilise
such technologies and create an environment that enables citizens to lead environmentally‐friendly
lifestyles. At their core, PEDs create value across three sustainability dimensions: environmental,
social, and economic.
PEDs and PED‐like projects can be developed in a variety of ways and are a product of the physical,
social, and economic characteristics of the environment. Innovative business models – the
configurations in which value is created, delivered, and captured – are integral to leveraging these
contextual characteristics in order to achieve the goals of PEDs. This study aims to identify best
practice cases and categorise them into archetypes of business models operating in PEDs in order to
summarise the opportunities available in PED creation.
The authors synthesise existing literature in the area of sustainable business models to develop a
conceptual framework that analyses the extent to which the value dimensions of business models
address the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability, with a focus on PEDs.
This allows the building blocks of the original business model canvas to be modified and extended.
The authors use a qualitative analytical approach, to a set of selected European cases, through the
lens of the conceptual framework to identify business model archetypes of PEDs and PED‐like projects.
Three business model archetypes and seven sub‐archetypes have been identified:

Summary of identified archetypes and sub‐archetypes of business model opportunities in PEDs

The authors find that the aims of the business models under the archetypes and sub‐archetypes vary
in priorities. For example, while the People‐oriented renewable energy communities that encourage
6

self‐sufficiency archetype is heavily focused on creating value for the community, the other two
archetypes are more centred on creating environmental and economic value. Nevertheless, the
resulting outcomes are multi‐dimensional in their value creation.
The identified archetypes and their sub‐archetypes showcase the diversity of opportunities that are
available in designing a business model that creates social, environmental, and economic value in PEDs
or PED‐like projects. Further, the key features of the sub‐archetypes demonstrate which business
model elements are critical in achieving their aims, whether it is stakeholder partnerships or
technological innovation. This understanding is important as it can determine the source and
magnitude of investment dedicated to the development of the PED.
The contribution of this study lies in the creation of a common understanding of the possibilities
present in PED development through the identification of the relevant business model archetypes.
The future deliverable of this work package will use these business model archetypes to build an open
source web‐based tool that can serve as a starting point for PED development discussions among
citizens, municipalities, investors, and other stakeholders.

1 Introduction
The EU’s Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan [1] proposes the development and implementation
of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) to facilitate the transition towards a climate neutral energy system1.
As part of the smart cities and communities concept (SET‐Plan Action 3.2), PEDs are described as
districts with annual net‐zero energy import and net‐zero CO2 emissions, working towards an annual
local surplus production of renewable energy, at an affordable level [1]. They enable energy cost
reductions and improvements in performance of low carbon energy technologies through efficient
and flexible energy consumption. In this way, the PED concept addresses the environmental
dimension by setting energy goals, while simultaneously focusing on economic and social dimensions,
such as reduced energy costs, access to affordable living, and a built environment that aims at
encouraging the adoption of lifestyles that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These values may
be supported in a multitude of ways: through incentives for the transition to electric vehicles; the
production of own energy from renewable resources such as solar and wind; the replacement of fossil
fuels based technologies with more sustainable ones, such as heat pumps for heating; and/or
management of energy consumption through smart technology. The successful planning, deployment,
and replication of PEDs will partially rely on the development of sustainable business models 2 . A
business model is defined as the basis “of how an organisation creates, delivers, and captures value”
[2].
The aim of this study is two‐fold:
1. to identify best practice business models for energy generation, distribution, and
management in PEDs or PED‐like3 environments;
2. to categorise these business models into archetypes illustrating the different priorities that
might emerge and their tendency to lead to socially inclusive propositions.

1

The defining aspects, or “building blocks” of PEDs according to the SET‐Plan 1 are:

A PED is embedded in an urban and regional energy system, preferably driven by renewable energy sources (RES),
in order to provide optimised security and flexibility of supply.

A PED is based on a high level of energy efficiency, in order to keep annual local energy consumption lower than
the amount of locally produced renewable energy.

Within the regional energy system, a PED enables the use of renewable energy by offering optimised flexibility and
in managing consumption and storage capacities on demand. Active management will allow for balancing and
optimisation, peak shaving, load shifting, demand response and reduced curtailment of RES, and district‐level self‐
consumption of electricity and thermal energy.

A PED couples the built environment, sustainable production and consumption, and mobility to reduce energy use
and greenhouse gas emissions and to create added value and incentives for the consumer. E.g., PEDs facilitate
increased EV charging capability within the district and ensure that the impact of EVs on the distribution will be
minimised by using local generation where possible.

A PED makes optimal use of elements such as advanced materials, local RES and other low carbon energy sources
(e.g. waste heat from industry and service sector, such as data centres), local storage, smart energy grids, demand‐
response, cutting edge energy management (electricity, heating and cooling), user interaction/involvement and
Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

PED should offer affordable living for the inhabitants.

2

A business model can be seen as a framework that describes how a firm creates and delivers value via a number of elements
(e.g. key partners, key activities, key resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments,
cost structure, and revenue streamsii).

3 PED‐like projects refer to projects which are not fully implemented but resemble or aspire to be PEDs or projects that can
contribute to PED building blocks.

D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

Several authors advocate a transition from the earlier business model definition to definitions that
incorporate the concept of sustainable systems [3][4] [5][6] or focus on environmental aspects, such
as waste and pollution minimisation while underscoring social value (e.g. the circular economy model)
[7][8][9]. Additionally, authors have created new frameworks for analysis that modify and extend the
building blocks of the original business model canvas [10] [11]. Despite the variation in business model
definitions, there is a common emphasis on the inclusion of value proposition, value creation and
delivery, and value capture as guiding components in the business model [10]. These value dimensions
can be used as an analytical tool for identifying different business model archetypes [8][9]. At the
same time, business model research often addresses and analyses sustainability dimensions of
business models and archetypes [8][9][12][13]. The analysed sustainability dimensions in this study
are categorised into economic, social, and environmental dimensions [3][4][14].
To achieve the aim of the study, the authors designed a conceptual framework (Figure 1‐1) that allows
for the classification of information and, eventually, categorisation into PED business model
archetypes. The application of the conceptual framework to the general definition of PEDs shows how
their goals fit across the sustainability dimensions. Each value dimension can create an impact in the
economic, environmental, and social dimensions to varying extents and is described by key
components (bolded in Figure 1‐1).
In identifying archetypes, the authors seek to develop a common language for policymakers,
entrepreneurs, and citizens, encouraging replication and promoting the deployment of PEDs. Each
business model archetype is representative in the way it creates, delivers, and captures value –
described by the value proposition, value creation and delivery, and value capture columns in the
framework – and how these address economic, social, and environmental dimensions.

from academic literature [2][8][10][12] and PED framework [1].
Value proposition describes products and services provided in the business model to generate
economic return 7. The nature of PEDs enables a complex set of propositions of products, services,
and technological platforms that might be linked to economic, environmental, and/or social values
depending on the priorities of each PED and PED‐like project. The main aim of these propositions,
under a sustainable perspective, is to achieve an annual positive energy balance while providing
positive social and environmental benefits to the community. This aim is the cornerstone, providing
opportunities for energy services, flexibility, and sustainable consumption that can reduce GHG
9

D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

emissions and create revenue streams from optimised or even reduced energy costs. These services,
in combination with further incentives and the inclusion of the citizens/users in the design and
decision‐making process, facilitate a sustainable and affordable living environment in line with the
PED vision.
These propositions are achieved by a value creation and delivery process that optimises local energy
generation, distribution, and management, based on renewable energy sources. Value creation and
delivery is the central process by which the value proposition is implemented in a business model [7].
According to the literature, this dimension is supported by the key value chain elements of resources,
technologies, channels, partners, key competencies and key capabilities [9]. However, varying
localised contexts of PEDs make it challenging to find one standardised arrangement for these
elements. Different configurations can capture various visions and building blocks of a PED project.
Value creation and delivery in PEDs include activities and partnerships that aim to provide local energy
and optimise supply and demand. In this study, value creation and delivery is described by stakeholder
relationships and technologies used. These two key elements vary according to each project and
depend on the drivers, stakeholders, and size (area and beneficiaries).
The value creation and delivery process creates value in the economic dimension by offering
renewable energy generation, distribution, and management in a way that provides financial
opportunities for both the customer and the service provider. These energy products and services also
create environmental benefits. For example, environmental value is delivered by substituting
traditional energy sources with renewable ones, including innovative smart technologies that enable
energy efficiency (i.e. optimising energy use by leveraging data), or promoting change in individual
energy consumption behaviour. These approaches reduce a community’s environmental footprint and
contribute to the wider societal need for reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions to mitigate
climate change. Value is created through stakeholder partnerships – prosumers, end‐users,
technology owners and other partners – who take a leading role in achieving the sustainable energy
transition [3]. Further, these partnerships between stakeholders reduce costs, bring investment, and
enable cooperative structures of ownership that involve members as economic beneficiaries. Citizen
participation is also critical to raising awareness around energy use and citizens are included in
decision‐making and planning processes. Hence, this framework recognises partnerships between
different stakeholders as a way to promote greater social inclusiveness, to increase energy
affordability [15], and to consider stakeholders’ needs, maximising value for all.
Value capture for a sustainable business model is defined as the leveraging of cost structure,
investments, and revenue streams that result from the products and services provided to the users
and consumers in order to contribute to the environment and society [7]. Financial flows within a PED
will vary depending on whether a PED or PED‐like area is newly built or just being expanded, renovated,
or transformed. Environmental value is captured through the reduced costs of carbon emissions,
investments in ’green’ technology, and revenues from clean energy generation. Economic value is
captured through energy cost reductions via energy efficiency, new revenue streams for prosumers
and technology owners through energy generation and distribution, and creation of jobs [ 16 ].
Partnerships between stakeholders can create and deliver the economic values of PEDs through
investments in new technologies, enabling end‐users to become prosumers and profit from the PED
energy services.
It is important to note the two‐fold creation and capture of economic value that occurs for the product
or service provider in the business model and the user of the products and services. While creation of
economic value in the sustainability dimension is traditionally seen as the creation of local jobs or
access to affordable energy, these benefits may stem from the economic value that the product or
10

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

service provider receives. For example, reduced operation costs can lead to reduced energy prices for
consumers, thus enabling energy affordability. In this study, the authors recognise this relationship
and take economic sustainability to encompass all of these characteristics. Within the concept of the
business model, creation of value in the economic dimension can include revenues for product or
service providers and costs for consumers. However, economic value can also refer to benefits that
are accrued to the individual and community, such as job creation or growth of the local economy.
To identify business model archetypes of operating PEDs, the authors used a qualitative abductive
approach, analysing a set of case studies through the lenses of the conceptual framework. A collective
case study approach enabled the authors to identify differences between multiple cases. Instrumental
case studies are later used to present archetypes connected to particular cases [17].

2 Framework of analysis
In this study, the conceptual framework is used as an analytical tool in order to categorise business
models for energy generation, distribution, and management in PED or PED‐like projects into distinct
business model archetypes. Secondary data was collected for information gathering, evidence
building, and identification of best practice cases of business models for energy generation and
management in PED or PED‐like projects. The authors used the JPI Urban Europe’s Booklet of PEDs as
a starting point for information and case study collection, but the research was further expanded to
online databases and platforms focused on renewable energy projects, journals in business
management, environmental science, and urban planning domains, and reports and deliverables
produced by EU projects and initiatives working with renewable energy communities such as PEDs.
Lastly, websites, conference presentations, newspaper articles, and national magazines were explored
for additional information.
The case study selection was guided by a set of criteria (derived from the SET‐Plan definition of PEDs).
Selected business models were expected to:





contribute to energy generation, distribution, and management, especially in a
PED‐context;
have been implemented (i.e., they should be operational and not proposed just
as designs or ideas for the future);
aim to address social and human‐centric aspects;
have a focus on Europe.

Cases needed to satisfy all four criteria to be selected.
The authors then identified and codified shared characteristics across the selected cases. The
codifications were cross‐validated through a process in which all authors coded the examples
independently and discussed the results. Following other studies on sustainable business models, the
authors disentangled these characteristics into common elements, which share a similar purpose to
the business model building blocks: products and services, technology, stakeholders, and financial
aspects (investment, costs, and revenue streams). In line with other analyses [18][19][20], the set of
common PED elements was grouped according to value proposition, value creation and delivery, and
value capture.
Figure 2‐1 shows the process of case study selection, codification of elements, and placement of these
elements in the business model schematic under the lenses of the conceptual framework. Hence, the
figure provides an overview of the methodology that led to the analysis of the cases and their grouping
into archetypes. The business model schematic (represented by the arrow) demonstrates how the
common business model elements identified by the authors fall into the three value dimensions. Each
value dimension has the potential to create economic, social, and environmental value through a
combination of these elements. Analysis of these elements within the value dimensions helps explain
how a case’s business model creates value in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. A
matrix (see Appendix B) of all identified case studies was constructed to identify the key values of each
business model. Thematic analysis was then used to identify and demonstrate commonalities and
differences among the cases’ business models.
Based on this process, the authors were able to group the cases according to the key features of their
business model. Considerations of the complexity and scale of the cases, the enabler of the business

12

D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

model, and the relation to the sustainability dimensions have led to further grouping of a higher order.
As a result, archetypes and subsequent sub‐archetypes were identified based on this analysis.

Figure 2‐1. Overview of steps taken in archetype identification.

13

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs

3 Case studies
Applying the criteria discussed in the previous section, the authors have identified 20 best practice PED
or PED‐like cases in Europe. The analysis of the cases through the iterative process of codification and
grouping of common elements revealed similarities and differences among the case studies. In addition
to natural differences in scale and complexity, the key stakeholders that drive and initiate these
projects present a main difference in the perspective that the business models can take. This has
implications for the creation of value across the sustainability dimensions (e.g. what type of value is
created, for whom, and to what extent).
This section is divided into seven sub‐sections that exemplify these differences. Each section provides
a full overview of a “representative case”, highlighting the business model elements that have helped
the project achieve its goals and describing the value that has been created for the sustainability
dimensions. Short descriptions of cases that share similar objectives and value propositions follow
these representative case studies to present further key differences and similarities across cases. Key
features of the representative case studies’ value dimensions are presented in the business model
schematics, while the business model schematics for the remaining case studies can be found in
Appendix A. Table 3‐1 presents this grouping of case studies into representative case studies and other
cases with similar features.

3.1 Cooperative Deltawind, the Netherlands: citizen‐led cooperative to achieve
environmental goals
The case of Cooperative Deltawind was chosen as a representative case study to
demonstrate how citizen ownership and management can create and deliver
environmental and economic values, with further possibility of achieving energy
self‐sufficiency. The Isle of Eigg is presented for comparison, as another fully
citizen‐led initiative in energy management.
Cooperative Deltawind, located on the island of Goeree‐Overflakkee, is one of the first and largest
renewable energy cooperatives in the Netherlands. It was established in 1989 at the islanders’ initiative
with the aim to generate and manage their own power in an environmentally‐friendly manner [21].
The cooperative was founded in reaction to a number of events – the oil crisis of the 1970s, the report
from the Club of Rome, and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986 [22]. These events
became a driver for the islanders to generate their own power through wind energy (Figure 3‐1) and
achieve energy self‐sufficiency.

Figure 3‐1. Wind turbines on Goeree‐Overflakkee island. [23]

Deltawind’s main value proposition was motivated by the goal to protect the environment by
eliminating dependency on fossil fuels. Pursuing this goal, the local citizens came together and initiated
a cooperative that allowed them to create renewable energy products and services through local
investments.
Value creation and delivery was possible through installation of renewable energy technology – in this
case, predominantly wind turbines. These wind turbines allowed the island to become energy self‐
sufficient and climate‐neutral and are mainly owned by the citizens. The first wind turbine was installed
in 1991 with the help of the first investors and the cooperation of the local energy company EMGO. By
1996, the first wind farm (Battenoert) was built in Nieuwe‐Tonge and became the largest in the country
at the time [21]. In addition to wind turbines, Deltawind has enhanced the production of renewable
energy with the installation of 2,960 solar panels [21]. This solar park is the first ground‐based solar
park of this scale in the country21. Deltawind consists of 2,500 members, mainly private individuals who
live on the island and comprise its main stakeholders [22]. The cooperative is driven by local
enthusiasm and robust engagement and was run by volunteers until the year 2000, when the
15

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

development of the second wind farm (Piet de Wit) triggered an increase in the professionalisation of
the renewable energy business. All electricity is supplied through a three‐party agreement with Eneco.
Now, Deltawind owns two wind farms on the island of Goeree‐Overflakkee with a total of 22 wind
turbines and is part owner of Windpark Krammer [21] which was established in collaboration with
Zeeuwind in 2017 and is the largest citizens’ initiative in the Netherlands [24]. The power generated
by Deltawind’s wind farms is supplied to half of the island’s 22,000 households.
This partnership between the islanders created not only social but also economic benefits. This
constitutes the value capture of the Deltawind business model. Deltawind requires a membership fee
to join the cooperative and is currently made up of 1566 members who have invested 3.9 million Euros
through loans [25]. These were issued for Windpark Krammer and supervised by the Netherlands
Authority for the Financial Markets, which is a novelty for the cooperatives [24]. In return, the
members are engaged in a profitable business, receiving a yearly revenue of 6% from the dividends.
Figure 3‐2 illustrates how the cooperative, driven by strong citizen engagement, can significantly
contribute to the environmental goals and energy transition of the country. This example highlights
the importance of a combination of innovative technologies and active local participation.

sustainability dimensions

3.1.1 Isle of Eigg, the UK
The Scottish Isle of Eigg has historically been dependent on expensive fossil fuels shipped to the island.
However, in 2004, the islanders began taking steps to transition to a self‐sufficient island powered by
renewables. Similar to the Cooperative Deltawind, the Isle of Eigg has been driven by strong citizen
engagement. Today, more than 90% of the island’s electricity is locally‐produced by three hydroelectric
plants, four wind turbines, and solar PV. The island also has storage capacity through batteries which
balance supply and demand and two back‐up diesel generators. This has allowed the island’s 96
residents to achieve 24‐hour electrification and self‐sufficiency [26]. Part of the success has been due
to funding from the EU, investment from the islanders, and a bank loan. The island’s energy
infrastructure is owned by Eigg Electric, a subsidiary of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust (set up by the
islanders in 1997 when they successfully bought the island). The size of the island allows residents to
be in control of their energy management and to work together to decide on various aspects of the
16

D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

energy system, including pricing. Residents have voted to allow each household to use a maximum of
5kW at one time and businesses are allowed 10 kW. If consumption exceeds this maximum, the
consumer’s electricity is cut off, and they must pay a fine. However, meters provide the necessary
information to prevent this from happening often [26]. Although similar in some respects to
Cooperative Deltawind, the Isle of Eigg differs in the scale of the project since it serves a much smaller
population.

3.2 Hunziker Areal, Switzerland: providing a social and environmentally‐friendly place
for living and working
The Hunziker Areal case study represents a best practice example for how a
holistic approach, which emphasises social and environmental dimensions, can
create a human‐centric and environmentally‐friendly place to live. The District of
Vauban and La Fleuriaye are presented alongside Hunziker Areal to underscore
how sustainable lifestyles in these districts are encouraged in a variety of ways,
with different end goals – through energy efficient technologies, alternate
mobility opportunities, and socially inclusive structures.
Hunziker Areal is a 41,000 square meter non‐profit housing project located on the site of a former
concrete factory in Zurich, Switzerland [27]. The construction of Hunziker Areal was completed in
2014/2015 and since then it has received several awards 1 due to its community‐promoting
architecture and economic, social, and environmental sustainability [28]. It was the first project of the
housing cooperative “mehr als wohnen” (English: “more than housing”) aimed at creating a sustainable
neighbourhood from wasteland [29] that could serve as a beacon [30] for other non‐profit housing
developments [31]. It consists of 13 buildings, which provide living space for approximately 1300
citizens from a diverse range of backgrounds and income levels. The project has also created 150 new
jobs in the area [27].
Hunziker Areal’s value proposition reflects a holistic approach that is driven by the vision to provide an
inclusive and environmentally‐friendly place for living and working. Thus, the district’s products and
services focus on supporting affordable living, optimising energy management to increase energy
efficiency and thermal comfort, and establishing an engaging and participatory environment for
citizens (Figure 3‐3) [27][32].

D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

Hunziker Areal is able to create and deliver its intended social value through its cooperative structure
that lies at the centre of the project. In 2007, the city of Zurich and about 50 housing cooperatives of
Zurich founded the housing cooperative “mehr als wohnen”, the core stakeholder of the Hunziker
Areal project [28]. The development of Hunziker Areal was a collaborative project that involved several
stakeholders (architects, neighbours, founding cooperatives, and the city government) and ensured
citizen participation [28]. Additionally, residents need to be members of the cooperative to live in
Hunziker Areal [34]. Consequently, the project naturally creates a participatory environment [35],
which allows residents to engage with the community. Thus, Hunziker Areal’s residents also become
stakeholders in the district’s development and various initiatives. Further, the district is designed to
provide living and working opportunities for people from different social backgrounds, income, and
abilities. 20% of the housing facilities are rented out to people with limited income [27].
To fulfil the environmental goals of the housing project, the cooperative partnered with the local Swiss
utility supplier EWZ [36], the municipal data centre (OIZ Albis), and Lemon Consult AG [30]. Together,
these partnerships help to achieve the cooperative’s low energy – low tech approach [28]. This
approach relies on conscious energy consumption by citizens, as well as energy efficiency and the
application of different technologies: Minergie‐certified buildings, district heating that uses warm
exhaust air from OIZ Albis located next to the project, collective self‐consumption of local green energy
from rooftop solar PV (ewz. solarsplit), and smart optimisation platforms for energy and heating
[27][30]. The residents can decide their source of electricity, but are encouraged to use the local self‐
consumption concept [36]. Mobility solutions and the possibility to satisfy living and working needs
within the district allow the citizens to minimise their mobility‐related energy consumption [27][32].
Together, these approaches have led the district to comply with 2000‐watt society energy measures.
The cooperative consults Lemon Consult AG to keep track of the district’s energy compliance [27][30].
Hunziker Areal’s self‐consumption model allows citizens to capture value through reduced energy
costs in comparison to traditional energy supply [36]. The creation of micro jobs, democratic
participation processes, and membership rights contribute to social sustainability and to the provision
of an attractive living environment. As the owner of the photovoltaic (PV) system, the cooperative
receives revenue from its energy sales to the citizens and to the grid and a quarterly credit for its solar
electricity from EWZ [36]. The cooperative benefits economically from its heating concept that has
generated savings of up to 30% / 40'000CHF of yearly heating costs in comparison to conventional
heating [30]. Furthermore, cost‐effective construction and sharing of risks among the stakeholders
during the development process ensured the feasibility of this social housing concept [28]. Finally, the
replicability of the concept of Hunziker Areal may be demonstrated by the planned development of
another similar participatory project in Oberwinterthur (Switzerland) [37]. Figure 3‐4 shows the core
factors of the Hunziker Areal business model.

and sustainability dimensions

3.2.1 District of Vauban, Germany
The district of Vauban (Freiburg, Germany) demonstrates similarity in key features to Hunziker Areal,
also focusing on creating value in the socio‐environmental dimension. The construction of the Vauban
urban district was initiated by citizens and supported by the city of Freiburg. The citizens founded the
cooperative “Forum Vauban” in 1993, with which the participatory construction and development
process started. Vauban also aims to provide an environmentally‐friendly living and working
environment to its residents [38]. The vision includes a holistic mobility concept to keep the district
largely car‐free, to apply renewable technologies such as solar rooftop PV and district heating solutions,
and to construct passive houses (low‐energy construction) [39]. The district does not focus on social
housing like Hunziker Areal but appreciates and recognises the different social groups and mix of
residential and commercial spaces that ensure the liveliness of the district [40].

3.2.2 La Fleuriaye (Carquefou), France
La Fleuriaye (Carquefou) in France is a newly built district like Vauban and Hunziker Areal. Construction
was initiated by the city of Carquefou (part of Nantes Métropole) and implemented by a public
engineering agency (Loire‐Atlantique Développement ‐ SELA) together with a total of 18 partners,
including the municipality and an energy company. This project was developed in two phases focused
on two sub‐districts: West (residential area) and East (business area). La Fleuriaye West strives to
provide a comfortable living environment. The district combines different technological approaches
including solar PV and biomass for energy production, passive houses, smart technology, and soft
mobility for energy efficiency and management. Through this approach, the district aims at energy self‐
sufficiency and efficiency. Similar to Hunziker Areal and Vauban, La Fleuriaye prioritises the social
aspect of sustainability [41].

3.3 Samsø Island, Denmark: achieving energy self‐sufficiency
Samsø Island was chosen as a representative case study to showcase its rapid
transition to self‐sufficiency with relatively little government intervention, active
involvement of the local community, and innovative technologies. The three
accompanying cases, Schoonschip, Aardehuizen, and the Orkney Islands,
demonstrate other ways in which citizen‐led self‐sufficiency is being achieved
across a number of environmental dimensions (e.g. waste and water
management), despite varying scale and physical boundaries.
Denmark’s island of Samsø became the world’s first 100% renewable island, powered mainly by wind
energy [42] (Figure 3‐5). By 2007, the island had achieved its ten‐year masterplan of becoming a model
renewable energy community [43]. The island of Samsø serves as an example for others in achieving
self‐sufficiency based on renewable energy, thus demonstrating the positive energy concept in its
business model.

Figure 3‐5. Impression of the Samsø island’s wind turbines. [44]

The island of Samsø is 114 square km in area and located in the Kattegat Strait, between the mainland
of Jutland and the island of Zealand in Denmark. The island has a population of 3,724 people (as of
2017). In 1997, the island was entirely dependent on fossil fuels imported from the mainland; growing
unemployment and emigration caused increasing depopulation [ 45 ]. That year, Samsø won a
government competition to become an energy self‐sufficient island based on 100% renewable energy
sources. The island municipality and its population saw the potential of the renewables to secure
energy independence, build up the local economy, and provide jobs [43]. The main drivers for the
islanders to become energy self‐sufficient were high electricity costs, operational cost savings that
could result from self‐sufficiency, reliability and stability of the energy supply, and independence from
the traditional energy system [ 46 ]. The energy, environmental, and socio‐economic challenges
influenced the goals of the islanders to become energy independent and CO2 neutral based on
renewable sources.
With these drivers in mind, Samsø’s main value proposition was environmentally, socially, and
economically motivated. The products and services offered to achieve this value proposition would
need to ensure that sufficient energy was produced to meet local energy demand, foster a carbon‐free
environment and energy independence, and promote sustainable mobility.
As Samsø shifted away from fossil fuels, it replaced its energy production with offshore and onshore
wind turbines, with some additional contribution from solar PV. Value was created and delivered
20

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

through the combination of innovative technologies such as wind turbines, biomass district heating
plants, and improvements in transportation and energy conservation. The electricity on the island is
supplied by 21 wind turbines (10 offshore and 11 onshore) installed between 1998 and 2001 and which
covered the island’s energy needs by 2002 [43]. To provide heating to the islanders, three district
heating plants were built by 2005. Heat production based on renewable energy such as biomass and
solar energy rose from 25% in 1997 to 65% in 2005 [43]. These technologies are used and owned mainly
by the citizens, which promotes their strong engagement and cooperation with other stakeholders
including the local energy agency, the municipality of Samsø, the local development office, and the
municipally‐owned energy company.
The renewable energy produced on the island has brought many environmental benefits, offsetting
the CO2 emissions caused by traffic and other sources on the island. Nowadays, the islanders have an
average annual CO2 footprint of negative 12 tonnes per person, compared with the Danish average of
6.2 tonnes [47]. Samsø benefits from recycling all resources with minimal waste. A biogas plant was
built that converts food waste, vegetation waste, and grass into biogas for use as fuel for the ferries.
At the same time, residual products serve as fertiliser on farms [43]. Sustainable mobility is promoted
by replacing all transport, including ferries, cars, and other fossil fuel‐powered vehicles with electric or
biofuel vehicles. Samsø’s inhabitants own the highest number of electric cars per capita in Denmark.
Electric cars constitute 90% of all vehicles on the island, while the ferry runs on biogas. These efforts
have made Samsø CO2‐neutral.
The value creation process also produced social benefit by focusing on the inclusion of Samsø’s
residents. Local communities’ engagement and acceptance of renewable energy was considered a
‘natural’ process as the entrepreneurial spirit of the local citizens and partnerships with local
stakeholders increased the likelihood of community benefits and support [45]. External support
through funding programmes and expert assistance also played a crucial role in developing ‘shared
visions’ for achieving the common energy goal. Additionally, flexible energy policies allowed renewable
energy projects to be adapted to the needs and motivations of the citizens.
The favourable funding possibilities that were available at the time of implementation made the
project possible. This constitutes the value capture of the business model of Samsø. The total cost of
the project was 57 million euros from 1998 to 2007, while 70% of the investments came from local
investors and islanders [43]. The government offered financial support for technological solutions, such
as subsidies and tax incentives, to local communities to launch the project and secure its financial
viability45. Samsø’s inhabitants benefited economically as well: the local homeowners were granted
subsidies of up to 30% of the cost of converting to solar thermal, biomass or heat pump installations,
and energy efficient refurbishments. To create more value on the island, the installation work was
carried out only by local tradesmen, thus meeting the goal of building up the local economy and
creating jobs. Nowadays, the ownership of the technology creates revenues from energy sales,
boosting the local economy since the money remains on the island. The surplus energy is exported to
neighbouring Jutland, which also contributes to the financial returns (Figure 3‐6).

and sustainability dimensions

3.3.1 The Orkney Islands, the UK
The Orkney Islands are an archipelago off the north coast of Scotland that have depended on
renewable energy technologies based in wind, wave, and tidal resources for over 30 years [48]. The
Orkney Islands energy transition is economically driven [49] and initiated and enabled by the local
community [50]. The citizens achieved energy self‐sufficiency [51] by investing in over 500 small and
medium‐sized wind turbines for their farms or gardens [52]. The local supply chain helped to decrease
the negative impact on the local environment or community and created significant benefits to the
local economy through revenue from energy sales, creation of jobs, and affordable prices for
consumers [53]. The aims and objectives [54] for transforming Orkney islands into sustainable islands
have evolved during the island’s energy journey to address different challenges (e.g. curtailments of
wind turbines) and to reduce dependency on economic benefits [52]. Diversification of activities and
partnerships [49][50] in this community‐driven energy transition has led the Orkney Islands to address
energy efficiency and fuel poverty, to decarbonise electricity[48], to establish a marine energy test site
[55], and to introduce a smart‐grid [56], innovative heating, energy storage, and energy management
solutions [57].

3.3.2 Schoonschip, the Netherlands
Schoonschip is a Dutch floating residential area with a total of 46 newly‐built households in the Johan
van Hasselt canal, Amsterdam. The project was initiated by the citizens (over 100 future residents) in
2012 and is being implemented in partnership with the municipality and numerous other partners. It
is still under development but is planned to be functional in 2020 [58]. Similar to Samsø’s value
proposition, Schoonschip aims to become energy self‐sufficient through renewable energy and to
achieve climate neutrality, albeit on a smaller scale. The project generates its own electricity and heat
with solar panels and heat pumps, while effective insulation reduces energy consumption and losses.
Connection to the smart grid enables the residents to exchange electricity among each other to achieve
an energy balance. Aiming at climate neutrality, Schoonschip intends to apply environmentally‐friendly
solutions such as energy generation based on exclusively RES, sustainable waste and water
management, disconnection from the natural gas network, and promotion of e‐mobility. Efforts of
22

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

citizens contribute a great deal to the implementation of these solutions, while the economic benefits
are secondary.

3.3.3 Aardehuizen, the Netherlands
Aardehuizen is a community of 23 homes located in the municipality of Olst in the Netherlands. Like
the project on Samsø, the development of this self‐sufficient community was driven by the
engagement of citizens: it was built in cooperation between Transition Deventer (a citizen‐led
organisation focused on energy transition), the municipality, and regional experts to create a way of
living “in harmony with nature” [59][60]. Aardehuizen’s goal is to enable a self‐sufficient lifestyle that
encompasses all aspects of sustainability [60]. All of the homes were built with the help of the residents
and over 1,000 volunteers. Most of the materials for the construction were sourced within 50 km and
all energy needs are met through installed PV [59]. Although operating on a smaller scale compared to
Samsø, Aardehuizen aims to be fully energy self‐sufficient, relying on its inhabitants for energy
production and management through PV. The project contributes to environmental, social, and
economic dimensions by aiming to optimise use and re‐use of materials, ensuring that the community
is self‐sufficient in terms of energy, water, and sanitation, and strengthening mutual social efforts
toward this goal. Since its inception, the project has created different values for the community: it has
opened its bulk buying of solar panels to the citizens of Olst, created construction jobs, supported the
formation of a collective of eco‐carpenters, and organised many informational and skills‐building
events.

3.4 IssyGrid, France: developing smart grid/technology test platforms
The case of IssyGrid was chosen as a representative case study as it best
illustrates how success of a project can be achieved through the coming together
of stakeholders with different technical skill sets and knowledge bases (e.g.
stakeholders from the municipality, private companies, and research
organisations). The Smart Energy Åland project, presented alongside IssyGrid,
also demonstrates how a complex set of energy services is delivered through
partnerships, though at a different scale and within the boundary of an island.
In 2012, Bouygues Immobilier, a private property developer in France, initiated the development of
IssyGrid, with the goal of creating France’s first smart grid network with district‐level optimised energy
production and management. The project was supported by the mayor of Issy‐les‐Moulineaux and nine
additional companies joined the project. Located in the Seine Ouest business district and Fort d’Issy in
Issy‐les‐Moulineaux, IssyGrid services 1,600 homes (10,000 people in total) and an area of 160,000 m2
[61].
The development of IssyGrid was environmentally and economically motivated. While the main value
proposition was to create France’s first smart grid, appealing to new business, this was achieved
through products and services that promised to introduce a way to “consume better and less”,
integrate renewables into the grid, and optimise energy management across a diversity of uses (e.g.
office, home, shopping) [61]. In the end, the project was able to create social value as well, expanding
from the Seine Ouest business district to include the residential area of Fort d’Issy.

Figure 3‐7. The IssyGrid business district [62](left) and Fort d’Issy [63].

IssyGrid was able to create and deliver its mission through the power of stakeholder partnerships. Ten
partners from the municipality and a range of sectors came together to help develop IssyGrid (real
estate, telecommunications, energy and technology consulting, energy utility, and software sectors)1
[64]. Through this partnership, a number of technologies and technical strengths were made available
to make the project a reality. For example, EMBIX, a company that was born out of IssyGrid, manages
the information system and the analysis and optimisation of the smart grid’s energy flows across the
district [65][66]. Microsoft provides cloud services development, hosting, and management for the
large amount of energy data that needs to be stored and processed [67]. On the energy management
and optimisation side, a number of the partners have worked together to create the 14 interconnected
information systems that balance supply and demand [68]. In addition to analysing the energy use data
generated through connected sensors in the neighbourhoods, energy batteries make it possible to

absorb and store energy during production peaks. Bouygues contracted Renault to help bring recycled
batteries to the grid in order to store excess energy. Meanwhile, Enedis played a critical role in
IssyGrid’s aim of allowing users to track their energy use by installing 1,700 Linky meters in the
buildings. These smart meters allow users to check their energy use in real time and change their
behaviour to be more efficient energy users [69]. The oil and gas company, Total, which launched its
solar PV arm in 2011 [70] was responsible for the installation of the PV panels in IssyGrid. Bouygues
Energies and Services provided public lighting to the district, introducing dimming adjusted to the hour
of the day and traffic in order to save energy at night [64]. Finally, SoMobility, which was launched in
2015, has also joined the project to provide mobility solutions in the district [66].
Stakeholder engagement also led to the resolution of anticipated issues of data privacy that come
along with the monitoring of energy usage data. IssyGrid is notable as the first time that a procedure
for data use in smart grids was defined in agreement with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique
et des Libertés (CNIL) [71], an organization that protects individuals in line with the French Data
Protection Act, thus paving the way for future smart grid development.
The technologies these companies implemented in IssyGrid helped achieve the goal of optimising
energy management, thereby creating environmental value for the neighbourhood and greater area.
Additionally, the development created economic value, making the neighbourhood appealing to new
businesses and residents who could also benefit from reduced long‐term energy costs [64]. This is
important as the commune of Issy‐les‐Moulineaux is a hub for information and communication
technologies (ICT) companies [72].
Value capture in the IssyGrid development was also achieved through the partnerships between the
ten consortium companies. The partnering companies were able to share the initial investment of 2
million euros equally. As the partners are private companies, they accrue costs and revenues for the
products and services they offer, but economic benefit is also transferred to IssyGrid’s users who have
reduced energy costs through optimised energy management [73].
An added benefit captured in the IssyGrid development has been reputation‐building and the opening
of new opportunities for start‐ups involved in the consortium. At least two new companies, Embix and
SoMobility, were born out of work done at IssyGrid. Additionally, IssyGrid was able to expand into Fort
d’Issy, an adjoining residental neighbourhood that offers further economic, environmental, and social
value. Fort d’Issy aims to be an eco‐neighbourhood. The residential area holds 1,600 homes, around
20% of which is social housing, and boasts many shops, restaurants, and green spaces [74]. 60% of the
neighbourhood’s energy needs are met through renewables [75] and two geothermal wells cover 75%
of the neighbourhood’s heating needs[76][77]. The main priorities and key factors of the Issygrid
business model are summarised in Figure 3‐8.

3.4.1 Smart Energy Åland, Finland
Like IssyGrid, Smart Energy Åland is a smart grid project powered by stakeholder partnerships. Åland,
an autonomous island region belonging to Finland, has become a test bed for innovative renewable
energy technologies. The government of Åland initiated the project in 2014 as a way to reduce CO2
emissions and increase the share of renewable energy [78]. A variety of products and services have
been developed through this project to capture solar energy, wind energy, wave energy, and
geothermal energy. The project also includes solutions for e‐mobility, energy storage, and heat [79].
Similar to IssyGrid, Smart Energy Åland has been able to deliver innovative technologies due to the
varying expertise of a number of private stakeholders that have partnered with the municipality of
Åland and a number of research organisations [80]. Together, these partners have created the joint
venture Flexens, 50% owned by Clic innovation (a consortium of 46 Finnish companies, universities,
and research institutions) and 50% owned by the municipality of Åland and local energy operators [81]
[82][83] . The autonomous nature of the islands has also led to the project’s success as new policies
facilitating the smart grid development can be enacted easily and quickly [84]. Unlike IssyGrid, Smart
Energy Åland is highly dependent on citizens as stakeholders, both in awareness and prosumption.
Thus, solutions for flexibility management and storage are of great importance on Åland [85][86].

3.5 Händelö Industrial Park, Sweden: developing district heating through a symbiotic,
eco‐cycle network
Händelö is presented as a representative case study to showcase how a district
heating network can be created though a circular economy, the development of
a symbiotic network that leverages partnerships and maximises the reuse of
existing resources and by‐products. Projects in Pozo Barredo and Drammen are
presented for comparison to showcase other, relatively less complex approaches
to creating environmentally‐friendly district heating.
The Händelö bioenergy complex is located on an island belonging to Norrköping Kommune (Figure 3‐9)
in eastern Sweden. It is made up of industrial symbiotic activities comprising an ethanol plant, a biogas
plant, and an energy provider (E.ON) [87]. A combined heat and power (CHP) plant lies at the heart of
the complex, providing electricity, district heating, and other services to the residents of Norrköping
[88]. Within the symbiotic network, heat is delivered to the district heating network, electricity to the
grid, and steam to the nearby ethanol production plant which produces pure ethanol that is then used
as biogas to heavy duty vehicles and alternative fertilisers for the local agricultural activities. In turn,
the municipality of Norrköping provides household waste to be used as waste in the CHP plant.

Figure 3‐9. Händelö Industrial Park, Norrköping Kommune. [89]

The network’s dominant process is the utilisation and processing of waste and by‐products from
municipalities and the forest industry. Hence, Händelö’s value proposition is to enable eco‐cycle
thinking [90] and an effective use of resources in an environmentally and economically efficient way.
The industrial symbiosis network is a showcase of synergies between industrial, urban, and agricultural
activities for improving regional sustainability. This minimises dependence on fossil‐fuel resources and
contributes to the development of a bio‐based economy that tackles the challenges that often relate
to bio‐energy production (e.g. land‐use issues, transportation problems, and seasonality).
Value is created and delivered through a proactive collaboration of several stakeholders90. The energy
company, bio fuel production companies, companies from the agriculture, forestry, and logistic sectors,
recycling companies of various materials, and the Norrköping municipality are the major partners
involved. Together, they create a network that makes effective use of resource linkages and
applications of clean technologies, while being sensitive to the environmental characteristics of their
exchanges.
27

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

Economic and environmental value is captured through the reduction of operational costs. By using
the outputs of one process as input for another, Händelö has become a hub of industrial symbiosis and
environmental technology that stimulates a circular economy in the area [91]. The CHP plant also
receives a fee for the domestic waste it receives. Additionally, substantial investments and operational
costs are minimised from the steam generation. As a result, the complex attracts interest from business
developers and local authorities. Figure 3‐10 illustrates the key features of the Händelö business model.

Figure 3‐10. Händelö business model through the lenses of the conceptual framework representing value and
sustainability dimensions

3.5.1 Pozo Barredo, Spain
Pozo Barredo is based in the region of Asturias in Northwestern Spain. It is led by Hunosa, a company
which specialises in geothermal and biomass projects [92]. Its value proposition is to use geothermal
facilities to transform mine water into heat for the municipality’s public buildings such as hospitals,
universities, and schools. As in Händelö, the project is able to deliver district heating in a way that
leverages existing resources (e.g. geothermal, mine water). However, the project covers a smaller area
(1 km2) than the Händelö complex and given its site‐specific availability of both geothermal and mine
water, has geographical restrictions of replicability [93]. Nevertheless, it showcases the possibilities for
sustainable means to generate heat and has achieved a reduction on emissions of 636.85 tCO2/year
[92].

3.5.2 Drammen Kommune, Norway
The Drammen Kommune [94] in Norway also integrates renewable resources into the district heating
system. The project is currently in the process of upgrading the existing heating system that uses
electricity, bio‐mass, and gas to utilise seawater as a heat source for the industrial heat pump, moving
away from fossil and combustion fuels. Ambient water provides the ability to provide a high debit of
water, thus enabling the heat pumps to extract more heat [95]. The system is owned and operated by
a Drammen Fjernvarme, a company which is 50% owned by the municipal energy company and 50%
by a commercial energy company [96].

3.6 Egni Co‐op, the UK: expanding the deployment of PV
The case of Egni Co‐op was chosen as a representative case study to showcase
how deployment of PV can be done through a cooperative structure that engages
citizens in its environmental and economic value proposition. The cases of
Partagélec and Coopem also present approaches that deliver financial value to
citizens while creating environmental value through PV installation.
Egni cooperative (Co‐op) is a non‐profit, community‐owned energy cooperative situated in Wales [97].
The cooperative was founded in 2014 by Awel Aman Tawe with the support of Renew Wales to tackle
climate change on a local level [98]. For this purpose, Egni Co‐op aims to help increase the share of
renewable energy in Wales while engaging citizens in the development of rooftop solar PV. The
cooperative achieves this through the development of PV on public buildings and simultaneously
creating public awareness, acceptance, and inspiration for future generations [97]. Egni Co‐op raises
funds for these PV installations, plans, installs, and manages them with support of local partners [97].
The value proposition of Egni Co‐op’s business model is to deploy rooftop PV installations on public
buildings. At the same time, central to the business model are the cooperative share offers which allow
anyone with a similar mind‐set – but without the possibility of building their own rooftop PV – to
become a member and to invest into this technology, while receiving economic benefits through a “fair
rate of return” [98]. Through this approach they bring benefits to people and engage them in reducing
CO2 emissions to tackle climate change [99]. Thus, the core of Egni Co‐op’s business model delivers
social, environmental, and economic value to the citizens (Figure 3‐11) [100].

Figure 3‐11. Egni Co‐op provides environmental, economic, and social sustainability to all participants (left)
[100]. This concept provides solar PV on community buildings like the primary school “Ysgol y Bedol” (right).

[101]
Egni Co‐op’s value proposition uses its products and services to engage citizens, educate them, and
raise awareness of the benefits from the energy transition through the deployment of rooftop solar
PV. For example, it offers energy monitoring screens for each building equipped with PVs [102] to
inform the communities about their energy consumption and the energy and CO2 emissions savings
[103]. Schools such as “Ysgol y Bedol” are also able to benefit from this by teaching the students how
conscious energy consumption and renewable energy can be used to mitigate climate change.
These value propositions demonstrate that value is created and delivered through involvement of
different stakeholders and established technology (solar PV). In the first place, Egni Co‐op is
membership‐based, where anyone can become a member by buying shares. The “one member one
vote” principle of the cooperative allows members to get involved in the planning and decision‐making
process of developing the rooftop solar installations [104]. In addition, Egni Co‐op seeks partnerships
29

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

with local enterprises and communities for installation and maintenance. In short, Egni Co‐op delivers
value through funding, managing, and developing solar PV in cooperation with local stakeholders.
This leads to the value capture of Egni Co‐op [97], which describes the economic value that it generates
from its PV installations. The initial capital investment for these is funded through share offers. A share
costs £1, but the minimum investment is £50, and the maximum is £100.000. As the installation has a
life expectancy of 20 years, this investment is a long‐term investment, and the invested money cannot
be easily withdrawn [104]. During its first share offer in 2014, Egni Co‐op raised £230.000, which they
used to finance the installation of seven rooftop solar PV projects. These installations have saved more
than 63t of CO2 and reduced the energy bills of the communities in these buildings by £13.000 in 2018
[97], creating environmental and economic value for them. The communities can directly use their
locally produced green electricity at a cost which is 20% lower than that offered by a traditional supplier.
In fact, small member sites even get the electricity for free [97]. The majority of the electricity is fed to
the main power grid, from which the cooperative receives revenue from feed in tariffs (FITs). This
results in economic benefits for the shareholders as Egni Co‐op uses it to provide its members with an
average annual 4% rate of return on investment. The revenue is also used to cover various costs (e.g.
maintenance costs1) [104].
Figure 3‐12 shows how the analysed sustainability and value dimensions come together and form the
business model of Egni Co‐op. Since 2014 Egni Co‐op has successfully deployed rooftop solar on various
sites all over Wales [105] and even received awards for its engagement [106]. One of the latest projects
in Newport (Geraint Thomas National Velodrome in Newport2) exemplifies how an energy cooperative
business model can be used for the development of PV in PEDs, focusing on the inclusion of citizens.
In addition, Egni Co‐op aims to expand its outreach through projects that address fuel poverty [97].

3.6.1 Partagélec, France
The Partagélec project in France aims to promote the deployment of PV and the possible collective
self‐consumption of the locally produced green energy. This was initiated in 2016 and led by the city
of Pénestin while run and financially supported by an assembly of 15 adjacent municipalities (known
as Cap Atlantique). The project is driven by a partnership between municipalities, implementers,
sponsors, and the local community. It is a pilot project as part of the process of developing municipal
and inter‐municipal energy production and collective self‐consumption. Hence, the main objective of
the project is to promote and demonstrate the feasibility of PV electricity production and consumption
by local businesses and residents of the Closo business park, while leading to energy cost reductions
for the citizens [107].

3.6.2 Coopem, Belgium
While Partagélec and Egni Co‐op have a strong emphasis on sharing knowledge that results in increased
social value, Coopem is more enviro‐economically driven. Coopem (Cooperative Energy of Mouscron),
founded in 2017, is a cooperative created out of the desire to reduce the area’s carbon emissions and
promote the installation of more solar PV at accessible prices in Mouscron, a city located in the Walloon
region in Belgium. It is a joint venture between the city, the citizens of Mouscron, and two other
partners that assist in the technical part of PV installation (Energiris and Aralia) [108]. This marks a
main difference with the Egni Co‐Op, which owns the PV installations and takes over the finances of
the system. Coopem facilitates the purchase of solar PV by reducing upfront costs and providing
technical and administrative help in the process [108]. The cooperative offers PV at a reduced price to
citizens and leases it to businesses in exchange for green certificates. Coopem has managed to
complete around 100 installations since its inception, accounting for 1,145 PV solar panels (producing
around 292 MWh) [109].

3.6.3 Legendre Energie, France
Legendre Energie is a French private limited company based in Rennes, Bretagne [110], that we refer
as a representative case of enterprises that work with public authorities and companies to deploy PV
and provide efficiency services. Unlike the above co‐ops cases, Legendre deploys renewable energy
generation for profit demonstrating the commercial viability of such a proposition. The company
installs solar PV cells to commercial or public buildings which self‐consume their power or connect
directly to the electric grid. More than 70MW of solar has been installed between 2007 and 2020 across
500 facilities, including roofs and car park shelters.

3.7 Enedis, France: transitioning to data‐driven grid management
The case of Enedis’ Linky smart meter was chosen as a representative case study
to illustrate how the energy transition requires new technologies in the fields of
smart grids and how new services emerge through energy data‐driven platforms.
Furthermore, the opportunities that emerge through data management systems,
decentralised energy management systems, and new services at localised level
are demonstrated through Spectral’s products and engagement in local energy
community projects.
Enedis is a major public distribution system operator that manages the distribution grid throughout
France, the largest in Europe (13% of the European network) [111]. One of its objectives is to facilitate
the French energy transition by providing to the stakeholders in the electric power system with
innovative grid connection solutions and automations for facilitating the integration of distributed
renewable energy sources [112]. In December 2015, Enedis initiated the deployment of Linky [113], a
smart metering system (Figure 3‐13) that enables remote operations, shorter intervention times, and
more detailed monitoring of electricity consumption. Linky allows for the development of energy
efficiency services based on home automation [114], key to the transition to smart‐grid technologies.
Overall, Enedis aims at the development of new solutions that are based in the application of large
volumes of data in a large‐scale rollout112.

Figure 3‐13. A Linky smart meter. [115]

The development of the Linky smart meters was environmentally and economically motivated. The
value proposition of Enedis is to use new technologies in the fields of smart grids and data‐driven
systems. In particular, the Linky smart meter improves communication of energy usage between end
consumers, electricity suppliers, electricity producers, network managers, and local authorities.
Additionally, it allows network operations to become more dynamic due effective use of data,
improves response rate regarding the state of the network (e.g. localised level data profiles regarding
flow of voltage and ability to launch real‐time alarms at the data centre), maintenance (e.g. condition
of equipment, triggering preventive maintenance), and understanding of the consumers (e.g. change
of consumption patterns) [116].
Real‐time data monitoring through the Linky meter, combined with intensive data‐driven models, is
the key value creation instrument that helps optimise maintenance operations and energy system
management. Access to real time information on the field through the smart metering technology
allows the network to operate more effectively. Additionally, it allows the introduction of progressive
tariffs for different time periods with higher or lower tariffs for peak or low‐peak periods for users [113].
Furthermore, the use of the smart meter technology allows effective decentralised management at
the community level by managing energy generation and self‐consumption (balancing the local loop)
32

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

among the different stakeholders (e.g. local councils, cooperatives, commercial or low scale industrial
users, home owners) [116], and supporting local authorities in the development, optimisation, and
assessment of energy resources in the region [114]. Finally, smart metering technology can support
the deployment of small‐scale PVs in the energy mix by making remote energy management possible
at the household‐level.
Value is captured for Enedis through smart grid deployment, by improving its brand recognition as a
sustainable energy provider, generating revenues from the energy distribution network that become
transparent for its users, and at the same time reducing costs by creating more efficient network
management [114][117] Additionally, data collected and provided by Linky are the backbone of new
services, allowing for major changes in the decentralised distribution network management. Figure
3‐14 shows the core factors of the described business model.

Figure 3‐14. Enedis Smart grid deployment business model through the lenses of the conceptual framework
representing value and sustainability dimensions

3.7.1 Spectral, the Netherlands
Spectral’s value proposition is to create solutions for the current challenges faced by energy grids: a
fluctuating renewable energy stream, limitations in the amount of renewable energy supported by the
grid, and a need to better balance energy supply and demand [118]. Like Enedis’ Linky smart meter,
Spectral uses data‐driven solutions to create real‐time, predictive optimization of energy use in
buildings. Testing their products and services at Café de Ceuvel, a “clean‐tech playground”, and
working on community projects like Schoonschip in Amsterdam, Spectral enables the quick
deployment of smart grids and allows real‐estate owners to have a better view of their energy
efficiency performance [119] . Recently, Spectral has joined as the technical lead on the ATELIER project,
a consortium of partners that build PEDs across Europe [120]. Taking on new, ambitious projects
showcases Spectral’s technical strengths, builds the company’s reputation, and allows them to improve
their own products and services.

4 Business model archetypes
The analysis and grouping of the selected case studies according to the business model value
dimensions led to the identification of three main archetypes and seven sub‐archetypes (Figure 4‐1).
These showcase the diversity of opportunities that are available in designing a business model that
creates social, environmental, and economic value in PEDs or PED‐like projects. The detailed summary
of key value features of the case studies that have led to the archetypes and their description can be
found in Appendix B.
The names of the archetypes are generalised to allow for a diversity of methods in achieving their
broad value propositions. At the same time, the sub‐archetypes reveal more specific key features of
the selected case studies that allow them to create the promised value. Figure 4‐1 summarises the
three archetypes and their sub‐archetypes. The business models falling under these archetypes create
economic, environmental, and social value for citizens and the community in different ways and to
varying extents.

Figure 4‐1. Business model archetypes and sub‐archetypes as well as the sustainability value they create for
their projects.

The archetypes demonstrate that a variety of initiatives and projects have been addressing the path
to a renewable energy transition for some time, independent of the concept of PEDs. The value
created by the studied business models enables movement in the direction of integrating renewable
energy technologies while, often, also creating a socially‐inclusive environment. The EU’s definition of
PEDs offers a chance to systematize these efforts and highlights the aims of energy decentralisation
and social integration in energy communities. Furthermore, the PED concept guides the energy
34

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

transition with useful principles and functions which must be achieved in a modern energy system
that prioritises social, environmental, and economic values [1].
The pathways of these projects evolve over time and are dependent on contextual conditions. The
examples of PEDs or PED‐like projects reveal that implementation is dependent on a facilitative
environment that is made up of: policies and regulations that foster development of energy
communities and allow adoption of renewable energy technologies; maturity of conversations among
stakeholders and the community; awareness of and readiness for adoption of new technologies;
engagement on the part of different stakeholders, including citizens; and availability of financial
resources and investment. These aspects highlight the path dependence of the projects which are only
able to flourish because past social, economic, and regulatory aspects motivated this development.
While motivation can result from an encouraging environment, motivation can also be reactionary, as
when island communities initiate a transition to self‐sufficiency to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Ultimately, environmental, economic, and social value is achieved through the deployment of
technologies, access to financing, and support from stakeholders. The use and combination of
different innovative technologies can be one step towards finding solutions for achieving energy goals.
However, access to financing should not be underestimated, as renewable energy projects are often
dependent on great capital investments and different financing streams.

4.1 People‐oriented renewable energy communities that encourage self‐sufficiency
The first archetype, "People‐oriented renewable energy communities that encourage self‐sufficiency",
describes ways that business models have created value by putting challenges that people and
communities face (e.g. equitable participation in benefits of new developments or engagement in
decision‐making processes) at the centre of renewable energy generation projects. In their value
propositions, these projects attempt to jointly create social, economic, and environmental value
through a combination of social initiatives and technologies that mitigate negative environmental
impact. The value proposition of this sub‐archetype includes fostering a sense of ownership and
stewardship of renewable energy technologies and services in a community. Citizens are given the
ability to actively manage the technology and to work collectively toward greater energy efficiency
and even energy self‐sufficiency.
This archetype concerns newly‐built districts just as it describes projects that evolve and continuously
develop in the direction of the PED vision. Among the three archetypes, this archetype represents case
studies with holistic drivers and goals closest to the PED vision. Consequently, this archetype has a
strong focus on all sustainability dimensions with a strong tendency towards socially inclusive
propositions. A key feature of this archetype is the critical position of the citizens and community in
delivering the value proposition (through citizen engagement and environmentally friendly lifestyles),
thereby creating environmental and economic value for themselves. Business models under this sub‐
archetype can also attempt to address energy injustice and affordability issues by increasing access to
(green) energy across different socio‐economic groups.
Sub‐archetypes of business models:


Driven by citizen ownership and management (Cooperative Deltawind and Isle of Eigg):
Projects under this sub‐archetype have been able to promote renewable energy technologies
and self‐sufficiency through strong citizen initiatives. Both the Isle of Eigg and Deltawind
demonstrate the power of citizens to come together to create strong environmental, social,
and economic value for themselves. They achieve this through ownership and self‐
management of the system of renewable energy technologies.
35

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book





Enables environmentally‐friendly lifestyles in human‐centric communities (Hunziker Areal,
Vauban, La Fleuriaye): This sub‐archetype describes projects of newly‐built districts that
empower their citizens to adopt lifestyles that reduce negative environmental impact, grow
the local economy, and engage in their community. This holistic goal is achieved through a
system of solutions that addresses energy, mobility, and social needs. These communities aim
at being socially inclusive and integrating people of various economic and social backgrounds.
For these human‐centric districts the social and environmental dimension is in the foreground,
while economic benefits for the initiators play a secondary role. In fact, incentives and
economic benefits to the citizens are created for them to fully enjoy an affordable
environmentally‐friendly lifestyle.
Creates path toward self‐sufficiency through synergy of social efforts and technological
solutions (Samsø Island, The Orkney Islands, Schoonschip, Aardehuizen): The key feature of
the projects under this sub‐archetype is their all‐inclusive goal of self‐sufficiency. For some
cases, like Samsø or Orkney, the need for self‐sufficiency may be tied to their island setting,
which makes dependence on traditional fossil fuels expensive. For other cases, like
Schoonschip and Aardehuizen, the wish for complete self‐sufficiency is driven by the wishes
of the residents who wish to create a climate‐neutral community. The path toward self‐
sufficiency goes beyond energy to include other sustainability efforts, such as waste and
water reuse. All of these projects rely on a combination of different renewable energy
technologies and a strong foundation of community and social cohesiveness. Enabling energy
self‐sufficiency provides strong environmental and social value for the citizens. The scale and
complexity of the projects can vary but involves several financing streams and needs strong
partnerships. The initiators may focus on creating value in the social and environmental
dimensions, but ultimately create positive impact in the economic dimension as well.

4.2 Large‐scale infrastructural environmentally‐friendly solutions
The second archetype, "Large‐scale infrastructural environmentally‐friendly solutions", captures ways
in which large‐scale infrastructural solutions can drive larger areas on the path to climate neutrality.
Infrastructural changes depend on systems thinking and partnerships between stakeholders that
leverage different technical capabilities, resources, and knowledge. Environmental value is created
through innovative technologies that reduce carbon emissions and maximise resource recycling, while
economic value is created through reduced costs for the service provider. Large infrastructural
projects can also help build the stakeholders’ experience and technical capabilities, while create
knowledge that can be shared with other project developers.
This archetype largely creates value in the economic dimension with less consideration for the social
inclusiveness than seen in the first archetype. This archetype presents rather complex project
approaches with innovative technologies at a large scale (IssyGrid, Smart Åland Islands, Händelö
Industrial Park), but can also focus on the roll‐out of one technological solution for district heating
(Pozo Barredo, Drammen). The key feature of this archetype is the leveraging of partnerships and
shared resources, thereby creating new opportunities and environmental and economic benefits for
the stakeholders. Sub‐archetypes within this category describe smart grid projects and district heating
projects that create a complex set of solutions for integrating renewable energy technologies to
existing districts.
Sub‐archetypes of business models:


Develops smart grid/technology test platform comprising multiple solutions (IssyGrid, Smart
Energy Åland): Cases under this sub‐archetype include smart grid and technology test bed
36

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book



projects that require the collaboration of stakeholders with a diversity of technical capabilities.
In both IssyGrid and Smart Energy Åland, partnerships between private companies, the
municipality, and research organisations create solutions for energy generation, management,
and consumption. Projects under this sub‐archetype can evolve with time, creating
opportunities for testing and integrating innovative technologies and leading to long‐term
economic and environmental win‐win situation for business partners and society. However,
the described technological approaches involve local communities that live in the districts and
have to use the technology effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the projects also need to
focus on social dimensions to enable benefits to the community while delivering their
technological value.
Provides environmentally‐friendly district heating (Händelö Industrial Park, Pozo Barredo,
Drammen): Projects under this sub‐archetype are focused on creating sustainable solutions
for heat generation at a district‐level. The three cases under this sub‐archetype optimise
renewable resources in different ways to achieve this goal. This is done through involvement
of different stakeholders, the circular economy approach, and other innovations in system
design that make effective use of waste and resources. Thus, these projects heavily focus on
reducing the strain on natural resources and optimising processes, while improving cost‐
effectiveness for service providers and industry partners. These sub‐archetypes create low
social value, as citizens are not actively involved in these projects, but benefit from having
environmentally‐friendly district heating.

4.3 Product service systems that facilitate the energy transition
The third archetype, “Product service systems that facilitate the energy transition”, describes business
models that provide technological solutions for the energy transition. Products and services in this
archetype create environmental value through renewable energy technologies, smart metering, and
data systems that can match energy demand with supply, eliminating any inefficiencies in energy
distribution. Business models in this archetype create solutions and work in partnership with
stakeholders such as energy service providers and citizens to provide the full value of energy efficiency
and carbon emissions reductions. They can also reduce costs throughout the value chain by optimising
energy supply and demand or leveraging cooperative financing models.
Business models that fall under the other two archetypes can be seen as the technological facilitators
in the first archetype. This archetype represents products and services that aid in the deployment of
renewable energy technologies and smart grid development. This third archetype’s value propositions
revolve around new technologies that can create environmental and economic value, with less focus
on the social dimension. Value creation in this archetype heavily depends on new technological
possibilities and the opportunities that are conceived through partnerships. These partnerships can
involve citizens and the community (e.g. through cooperatives), though to a lesser extent than in the
first archetype. The sub‐archetypes within this category showcase different ways in which economic
value can be created for the product or service provider while at the same time providing solutions
for climate change mitigation.
Sub‐archetypes of business models:


Expands the deployment of PV (Egni Co‐op, Partagélec, Coopem, Legendre Energie): Business
models in this sub‐archetype focus on facilitating the deployment of solar PV energy
technologies alongside financially beneficial consumption models. They deliver their value
proposition in a number of ways: cooperative structures that leverage financial incentives;
companies that deploy renewable energy technology for profit; strong partnerships with the
37

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book



local municipality, technology providers, and citizens; and utilisation of public building spaces
(e.g. public building rooftops). Value is created in the environmental dimension through the
deployment of solar PV and energy management technologies with the goal of mitigating
climate change. The case studies demonstrate that value can be captured through different
finance structures based on cooperative or commercial approaches and can create economic
value for different stakeholders (e.g. the reduction of upfront costs for solar PV installations
delivering socio‐economic value to citizens). For companies deploying PV for profit, it can
demonstrate the commercial viability of the product. However, this archetype may be
implemented at the community level to provide direct social and economic benefits back to
the citizens and the community. Hence, the social dimension is equally important to the
economic dimension in this sub‐archetype.
Utilises data‐driven technologies to manage and optimise energy demand‐supply (Enedis,
Spectral): Business models in this sub‐archetype create environmental value through their
technological solutions that leverage data in order to optimise energy supply and demand
and allow the network operations to become more dynamic. For example, Enedis’ Linky smart
meter can support deployment of large‐scale renewable energy infrastructure by enabling
remote operations and facilitating decentralised energy management in the local community.
Technologies in this archetype assist in the development of smart grids, provide support for
decentralised energy management systems, and are integral to emerging local renewable
energy communities (e.g. Spectral providing solutions for projects like Schoonschip in energy
supply‐demand optimisation). Businesses representing this archetype can be energy utilities
that provide new products and services as part of their business model innovation, start‐ups,
or research organisations. They develop data‐driven innovative technologies to provide
services to customers. Hence, the social dimension is less important than the economic
dimension.

4.4 Business model archetypes coming together
These case studies and the developed business model archetypes demonstrate potential approaches
that PED developers can take based on the value they wish to generate in PEDs. While the resulting
archetypes are distinct in their key value propositions, the case studies show that multiple benefits
can be offered simultaneously and across the sustainability dimensions (even when the initial priority
was to create environmental value). The sub‐archetypes also show that similar value propositions can
be created through different approaches to value creation and value capture. The approach taken can
depend on the scale of the project, stakeholders involved, and even the physical boundary (e.g. an
island community).
Goals and pathways of the project can also change – the Samsø and the Orkney Islands cases illustrate
how citizen‐initiated project can evolve over time to include different concepts and projects. In other
words, to reach their energy goals, the initiators need to overcome obstacles as they come evolving
with their goals. Hunziker Areal and Vauban also demonstrate this attitude throughout their
participatory development through their approach of "learning while building" following their vision
of social inclusiveness and environmentally friendly living solutions.
All case studies prioritise climate‐neutral solutions throughout their value chain and thus contribute
to one of the EU goals to achieve net zero CO2 emissions. Importantly, the case studies demonstrate
that strong engagement of citizens, partnerships, and skill and knowledge‐sharing are critical to
successful PED implementation. The analysis of the case studies revealed that these characteristics
stand out and helped initiate and drive projects. Citizen ownership and management, and the
38

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

enthusiasm it fosters, can help sustain an ambitious project. In particular, this can be seen in the cases
of islands such as Samsø Island, the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Eigg, as well as cooperatives that these
island communities initiate such as Deltawind. In these projects, citizen engagement was integral in
reaching the goal of reduced dependence on expensive fossil fuels.
The analysed cases demonstrated the various configurations in which investment for PED projects can
be acquired. The approaches can vary from social inclusive cooperative funding models to other
financial instruments or a combination of various financing options. The financing model of Egni Co‐
op, by engaging the citizens to invest, exemplifies how social and economic values can be combined
to fund renewable energy technologies. Partnerships can significantly contribute to making projects
financially possible. The case studies demonstrate that citizens and municipalities can raise initial
capital investments for PED and PED‐like projects and that joint projects between citizens,
municipalities, cooperatives, and/or private companies are most effective. IssyGrid and Smart Energy
Åland demonstrate how a consortium of private companies and research organizations can make a
project technically and financially viable. While Egni Co‐op’s model (and other cooperative and citizen‐
initiated models) relies on citizens as a financial stream, IssyGrid and Smart Energy Åland Island show
how external investments can be acquired by offering a technology testbed for various partners to
implement their technologies and benefit from the revenue streams. Thus, the prospect of
technological innovation and reputation‐building for the technology providers can be a way for
garnering new investment for PED and PED‐like projects.

5 Conclusion
In this study, the authors developed an understanding of the business model archetypes involved in
energy generation, distribution, and management in PEDs based on an evidence‐based case study
analysis. The study reveals that the identified business models create value beyond the environmental
dimension and generate benefits for the social and economic dimensions as well.
The PED business model archetypes identified summarise the contextual conditions needed for
implementation of PEDs and the potential for synergy in sustainability value creation and business
processes. Based on 20 case studies with different contexts and complexities, the authors identified
three business model archetypes:




People‐oriented renewable energy communities that encourage self‐sufficiency
Large‐scale infrastructural environmentally‐friendly solutions
Product service systems that facilitate the energy transition

These archetypes are generalised to allow for a diversity of applications but generate a common
understanding of the key features. Some possible applications are represented by the sub‐archetypes
that present specific key value features of the selected case studies that enable them to create value
across sustainability dimensions.
The conceptual framework used in this study helped guide the analysis of the business model cases,
and resulting archetypes, according to the sustainable value they create. The analysis showed that
there is a diversity of priorities around the sustainability dimension that is addressed through the value
proposition, value creation and delivery, and value capture. Further, the identified business model
archetypes show that value – economic, social, and environmental – can be accrued to varying extents
and goes beyond the product or service provider to other beneficiaries and involved actors, be it an
energy company or a local energy community. Stakeholders (e.g. end‐users, policymakers, investors,
implementers) are encouraged to examine archetypes depending on the value they aim to create,
though it is likely that created value will be cross‐dimensional.
The cases that comprise the archetypes demonstrate how business models in energy generation,
distribution, and management are moving in the direction of decentralisation. Decentralisation of
energy services is enabled by engagement of local stakeholders and citizens, while also fostering this
participatory environment. The archetype Product service systems that facilitate the energy transition
showcases technologies that enable decentralised energy generation and management – which can
also be implemented in the projects described by the other two archetypes.
To a varying extent, all case studies highlight the importance of delivering value in the social dimension
by creating benefits for citizens and the community. The social dimension is important to consider as
the outcomes of renewable energy projects need to go beyond creating environmental and economic
benefits and attend to the needs of citizens and society. This is in line with the EU’s definition of PEDs
as providing a socially inclusive environment that aims to address energy poverty. While not an explicit
goal of the analysed case studies, creating affordability in renewable energy technology installations
or reduced energy prices can begin to create a path toward alleviating energy poverty.
In other words, the case studies represent current examples of the paradigm shift [121] from a
centralised, provider‐consumer energy system, to a decentralized, human‐centric energy system. In a
such decentralised system, consumers are seen as active citizens with possibilities to participate in the
energy market or in decision‐making processes. Ambitions of sharing knowledge and success stories
and awareness raising initiatives of several of the presented case studies help to spread the word to
40

WP6 Business models and consumers’ value proposition for PEDs
D6.2 – Value generation by PEDs: Best practices case study book

make the citizens aware of the new role that they can take in mitigating climate change, and in future
living environments like PEDs.
Figure 5‐1 summarises the key messages for future stakeholders that have been identified from the
analysis of case studies and final archetypes with regard to the conceptual framework of analysis.

Figure 5‐1. Key messages derived from case studies and archetypes based on conceptual framework of PED
business models categorisation.

A limitation of the identified archetypes can be the extent of their replicability. PEDs are evolving
through different approaches and in different locations such as city districts or islands. Nevertheless,
since the concept has not yet been developed completely, this study analysed cases with business
models considered as PED‐like or useful to be part of a future PED. In fact, this study focused on a
limited number of cases, many of which had technological innovation at their heart. The identified
archetypes from these case studies cannot necessarily ensure exactly the same result in different
locations and at different times.
Future studies should focus on analysis of a larger number of PED cases in order to gain more clarity
around the archetypes. In particular, PED examples from different parts of continental Europe will
help to identify other business model archetypes applicable for diverse locations, which can ensure
replicability. Hence, the archetypes need to be regularly updated to reflect the latest state of the art
in PED implementation. The importance of the study lies in the undebatable need for the development
of innovative business models to facilitate the energy transition.
The future deliverable of this work package will use these business model archetypes to build an open

Definitions of key terms
Term

Definition

Archetype

This study identifies business model archetypes. A business
model archetype refers to a distinctive set of elements that
represent a group of business models (i.e. a categorization of
business models by their distinctive, comparable elements)

Business model

The way in which an organisation creates, delivers, and captures
value. Often described through business model components:
key partners, key/activities, key resources, value propositions,
customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost
structure, and revenue streams [2]

Positive Energy District (PED)

The EU SET‐Plan defines PEDs as: districts with annual net‐zero
energy import and net zero CO2 emissions, working towards an
annual local surplus production of renewable energy [1]

Prosumers

New entities in the energy value chain, such as citizens, that
produce, consume, store, and share energy with other users in
the grid or the main power grid [122]

Renewable energy sources (RES)

Renewable energy sources (RES) refer to renewable energy
technologies used to produce electricity and heat. These
innovative technologies harness the power of different
renewable sources e.g. wind, solar, hydroelectricity, biomass,
geothermal resources [123]

Sustainability dimensions

This study refers to the economic, environmental, and social
dimensions as sustainability dimensions. The authors recognise
that literature includes other categories such as technological or
organisational [8][9]

Stakeholders

Stakeholders and their relationships are important elements of
a business model. A stakeholder is a person or organisation that
is involved in or affected by the business structure. Key
stakeholders vary depending on the business model and may
play different roles in different business models. Depending on
the stakeholder perspective taken, the creation and capture of
value, as well as key features and drivers of the business model,
can be perceived in different ways (e.g. creator of products and
services vs. users of products and services)

Value capture

Cost structure, investments, and revenue streams that result
from the products and services [8][9]

Value creation and delivery

The central process by which the value proposition is
implemented in a business model, made up of key value chain
elements such as: resources, technologies, channels, partners,
key competencies and key capabilities [8][9]. The way in which
value is created and delivered can be perceived in different ways
depending on the stakeholder perspective taken (e.g. economic

benefit from the perspective of the company vs. the perspective
of the consumer)
Value dimensions

Value dimensions represent value proposition, value creation
and delivery, and value capture, that together describe a
business model from the value perspective

Value proposition

Products and services provided in the business model to
generate economic return [9]

About the Smart‐BEEjS Project
Energy transition is supported in the EU by legislative developments, such as the Strategic Energy Technology
Plan that aims to transfer power to consumers by decentralising the energy eco‐system at the local district‐
level. However, this transition occurrs at a time of increasing wealth inequality, energy poverty, and gender
difference. Thus, the long‐term vision of the Smart‐BEEjS project is to design transformational pathways that
tackle Energy Poverty and Justice, providing evidence and using the decentralised nature of ‘Positive Energy
Districts’ and ‘Networks of Districts’ as the central platform of transformation, whilst recognising the
economic, social and environmental challenges faced. Tackling the issue of energy injustice and poverty is an
essential pillar for contributing to the decarbonisation of our economies without leaving large parts of the
population behind.
Behind any decision or intervention – whatever the field of expertise, technological, business or policy – are
people. Therefore, the overarching training aim of Smart‐BEEjS is to provide, through a multilevel,
multidiscipline and interdisciplinary training platform, a programme to produce the technology, policy making
or business oriented transformative and influential champions of tomorrow; educated in the personal,
behavioural and societal concepts needed to deliver the success of any technological proposition or
intervention under the human‐centric perspective of energy justice.
The Smart‐BEEjS project recognises that the new level of decentralisation in the energy system requires the
systemic synergy of different stakeholders, who are inseparable and interrelate continuously to provide
feasible and sustainable solutions in the area of energy generation and energy efficiency. They balance
attention towards technological and policy‐oriented drivers from a series of perspectives:
 Citizens and Society, as final users and beneficiaries of PEDs;
 Decision Makers and Policy Frameworks, in a multilevel governance setting, which need to balance
different interests and context‐specific facets;
 Providers of Integrated Technologies, Infrastructure and Processes of Transition, as innovative
technologies and approaches available now or in the near future;
 Value generation providers and Business Model Innovation (BMI) for PEDs and networks of
districts, namely businesses, institutional and community‐initiated schemes that exploit business
models (BMs) to provide and extract value from the system.
In order to introduce cooperation and shared thinking, Smart‐BEEjS presents a balanced consortium of
beneficiaries and partners from different knowledge disciplines and different agents of the energy eco‐
system, to train at PhD level an initial generation of transformative and influential champions in policy
design, techno‐economic planning and Business Model Innovation in the energy sector, mindful of the
individual and social dimensions, as well as the nexus of interrelation between stakeholders in energy
generation, technology transition, efficiency and management.
The overarching aim of the project is to boost knowledge sharing across stakeholders, exploiting a human‐
centric and systemic approach to design Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) for sustainable living for all.
