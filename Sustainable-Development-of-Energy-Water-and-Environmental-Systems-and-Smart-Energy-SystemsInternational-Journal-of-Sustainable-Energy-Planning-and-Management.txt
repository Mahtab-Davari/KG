ABSTRACT

Keywords

This 34th volume of the International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management
includes papers from the 2021 conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and
Environmental Systems (SDEWES) held October 10-15, 2021, in Dubrovnik, Croatia as well as
the 7th International Conference on Smart Energy Systems held September 21-22 in Copenhagen,
Denmark and two normal papers. A focus area of this issue is district heating and district cooling
systems, with articles addressing resources for district heating and cooling systems, impacts of
having individual district heating metres for consumers and approaches to analysing district
heating systems. Another focus area is stakeholder involvement where two groups of researchers
focus on stakeholders from an energy island perspective as well as from a positive energy district
perspective. Both groups note the importance of factoring in stakeholders when devising
transition plans. Plans for increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources for the
Estonian, Latvia and Lithuanian systems are analysed using the Backbone model, finding modest
increases in system costs. Lastly, an article sets up an indicator system for assessing environmental
performance of European Union member states ranking, e.g., Estonian, Latvia and Lithuanian as
moderate (Estonia and Latvia) to weak (Lithuania) in terms of sustainable energy performance
score, based on 2019 data.

1. SDEWES Special Issue
In the first article of the SDEWES special issue, DelBusto & Mainar-Toledo [1] focus on European Union
islands tackling climate change targets within a complex
stakeholder arena. Based on experience from Málaga
and Cádiz (both Spain) and Sète (France) the authors
forward a suggested Participatory Process Protocol.
They apply their methodology to four clusters of islands
and use the experience for improving their approach.
Rygg et al. previously assessed social acceptance of
small hydropower station finding that local ownership is
important for local acceptance and participation. This is
also in line with extensive previous work by Hvelplund

http://doi.org/10.54337/ijsepm.7269

[2–4] showing the merits of local ownership when dealing with implementation and acceptance of energy technologies. Marczinkowski also previously emphasized
the importance of island studies in the energy transition[5].
District heating is seen as a key-component of decarbonised energy systems in Balen & Maljković [6]. Using
Croatia as an example, the authors investigate the
impact of having individual meters for measuring district heating usage as opposed to shared metres. The
authors assess that individual meters can affect a reduction in heat usage of about 40% compared to apartment
buildings with shared or common metres.

District heating is also the focal point for Pieper et al.
[7], who look into the identification of heat sources of
large heat pumps using geographical information system
(GHIS) software. They investigate both natural sources
such as lakes and rivers and man-made sources like
industries considering quantities, temperature levels and
location with respect to demand areas. Applying their
approach to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the authors
found TWh-scale industrial excess heat potentials in
each country – large proportions even within existing
district heating areas.
The energy systems of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
are also in focus by Putkonen et al. [8] who address the
phase-out of fossil-based electricity generation for
renewable energy sources as well as a desynchronisation
from the Russian electricity grid. Already planned measures would increase renewable energy exploitation
from 45% to 92% with only a moderate impact on costs.
The analyses by Putkonen and co-authors are based on
the Backbone energy systems analysis model developed
by Helistö and colleagues [9].
2. Smart Energy Systems Special issue
Volkova et al. [10] set up an approach to assess district
cooling and applied it to Tallinn as a case. Through an
assessment of cooling demands, distribution grid
requirements and heat cooling supply options, the
authors devised a district cooling system. The provision
of cooling came from a mixture of natural cooling,
waste heat-driven absorption heat pumps and electrical
chillers. This is what a new article describes as a
fourth-generation district cooling system [11]. Volkova
has previously assessed district heating regions in
Estonia [12] and presented an app for the promotion of
4th generation district heating [13] in this journal.
Fallahnejad et al. [14] investigate the differences in
applying two distinct district heating system assessment
approaches - the effective width approach versus a more
detailed optimisation-based approach with the aim of
identifying challenges from using the two approaches.
Results from the two are to some extent similar, so a
main determinant for the decision on approach is the
data availability, where the former requires less data.
District heating assessment methods in general is a
recurring theme[15–20] in this journal, emphasizing the
importance of the technology in the transition towards
renewable energy-based energy systems.

3. Ordinary articles
Rankinen et al. [21] focus on stakeholders involved in
the transition toward renewable energy-based energy
systems. Focusing on positive energy districts, the
authors address the diversity of stakeholders engaged in
the process of implementing such systems, concluding
amongst others that “management needs to incorporate
a stakeholder mindset” – i.e. keep a focus on the stakeholders affected by the process. Previous work in this
journal includes Butu’s [22] with a focus on stakeholders’ engagement in rural community energy projects as
well as the work on small hydro plants mentioned in
Section 1. Proimakis also addressed stakeholders – here
from a marine energy perspective[23] and Krogh et al.
looked into the stakeholders of 4th generation district
heating[24] and Bishoge[25], Tricarico [26] and Tomc
[27–29] explored various constellations of community
energy schemes with a focus on stakeholders.
Szép [30] takes a starting point in COVID 19, the
energy crisis and decarbonisation effort and developed a
set of indicators to assess the performance of nations.
Applying it to the European Union member states, they
rate Denmark, Sweden, Austria and France as robust –
whereas at the other end of their scale, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Poland and Lithuania are rated as weak.
Indicators have previously been explored in this journal
by Hernandez-Hurtado and Martin-del-Campo[31].
