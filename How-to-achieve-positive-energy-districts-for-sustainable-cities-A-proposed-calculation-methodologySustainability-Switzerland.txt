Abstract: In this paper, a methodology for calculating the energy balance at the district level and
energy performance of those districts aspiring to become a Positive Energy District (PED) is proposed.
PEDs are understood as districts that achieve a positive energy balance on an annual basis by means
of exporting more energy than is consumed within their limits. The main issue to standardize the
concept, besides which characteristics should be considered, is that current standards to calculate an
energy balance are not applied at the district level. This paper reviews the current standards and
adapts them to propose an energy balance calculation methodology. Calculation of an energy balance
at the district level is complex since it includes several parameters, such as which loads (or elements)
should be included, which renewable energy technologies should be considered on-site production,
and which primary energy factors should be used. The proposed methodology is thought to help
cities at the design stage of a district and to evaluate its annual energy balance. The methodology is
performed in eight steps, and all the needed assumptions that affect the calculation of the annual
energy balance are discussed in each step.

1. Introduction to Positive Energy Districts
Buildings account for 40% of total energy consumption in the European Union (EU) [1]
and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) derived from energy uses [2]. Thus, cities
are essential actors in fighting climate change, and have a high potential of reducing the
world’s global emissions [3], hence contributing to meeting COP21 targets. Furthermore,
cities have the commitment to enhancing inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urbanization [4]. Two main actions to achieve the transition towards more sustainable and
climate neutral cities are building renovations and the installation of distributed renewable
energy technologies within city limits [5]. In the EU, more than 220 million buildings
were built before 2001, with generally poor energy performance, and of which only 0.2%
perform deep renovations every year. This means that there is a huge potential for reducing
energy consumption in the building stock. Regulations and building codes have evolved
and continue evolving towards more efficient or nearly zero energy buildings, with EU
Directives 2010/31/EU and 2018/844/UE as clear examples of strong commitment to the
improvement of the energy efficiency of the building stock. A review of the main actions
of the European Union towards the development of the nearly zero energy building was
presented in [6]. Since 2018, the Positive Energy District concept (PED) has been introduced
to the discussion about the energy transition of the building stock, acknowledging that
districts can play a major role in this transition, as they tackle a larger scale of projects,

The terms and definitions of what is understood as “energy needs” and “energy use,”
among other terms, are based on ISO52000-1 and listed in Appendix A of this article.
2.1. Step 1: Define the PED Boundaries
The boundaries of a system can be defined as “a borderline that includes several
systems, installations, facilities and/or buildings that are interconnected with each other,
or with to some energy infrastructure, grid or virtual/contractual connection.” Thus, the
boundary is defined by the spatial and administrative relationship between the final energy
consumption and the energy generation units (inside the buildings or beyond the boundaries, e.g., the grid). Depending on the relationship, the PED can have virtual, geographical,
or functional boundaries according to the latest discussions of the EU initiatives (the EU
initiatives of JPI Urban Europe [11] and EERA [12] hold discussions among EU projects
and stakeholders on this topic.).
Regarding these discussions, when the boundaries are delimited by spatial–physical
limits, including delineated buildings, sites, and infrastructures, the PED is defined by
geographical boundaries. If the buildings are not close to each other, but are interconnected,
thanks to a gas, electric, or heating network, the PED has functional boundaries. If the
energy demand is covered by a generation unit, which is shared with other consumption
points (e.g., a windmill) and located outside the geographical boundaries of the PED, then
it could be considered a virtual boundary. It is currently debated whether or not a virtual
boundary could exist when the district cannot afford to own an energy infrastructure
and it purchases their RES energy by means of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or
by buying green energy certificates. Although certified green electricity is not seen as a
part of a PED, it is well recognized by article 15 of directive 2009/28/EC as a measure
that a city can apply in the emission inventories as a part of their Sustainable Energy
and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs) [18]. This raises the question: What if the positive
energy balance is achieved and green energy certificates are also considered? Should it be
a virtual PED? What if a PED uses Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to buy certified
green electricity? These questions are still under discussion, but it is important to note that
PEDs need to be seen as a solution to decarbonizing cities, helping to balance the grid, as
well as improving the quality of life of inhabitants. If PPAs or green energy certificates are
used, it will only help to force the numbers to achieve a positive energy balance, but it will
not contribute in a direct way to the city’s GHG emissions. This issue is mainly related to
the ownership of the power plant (within or beyond the geographical area of the PED),
which perhaps could be solved by including the energy operators and producers within the
project, as long as the operation of the PED involves the citizens. In the other definitions,
such as the REC from the REDII or the CEC from the IEMD proposal, the members are
natural persons (such as citizens), local authorities, including municipalities, or small
enterprises. IEMD also mentions microenterprises, and these members should effectively
control the community [19]. The draft of the EU REDII proposed that REC should include
at least 51% of the mem-bers of the community should be local members such as citizens
or municipalities, but this limit was not finally included in the recent approved directive.
Nevertheless, PEDs could take this limit as a reference, and follow a similar approach
when applying vir-tual boundaries. In Spain, the Institute for Diversification and Saving
of Energy (IDAE) specifies that LECs should welcome large companies as long as they
recognize and contribute to the objectives and roles of the community. How the entity
should be created and managed in the PED is still under discussion, but it is something
that can be adapted to each local context.
Another issue is whether or not these boundaries should have a certain size as a
requisite to become a PED. In PED projects being developed under EU funding from H2020,
specific requirements were implemented, such as “include at least 15,000 m2 floor area and
a minimum of three large buildings (new, retro-fitted or a combination of both)” [20]. The
minimum number of buildings and total floor area were mentioned, as well as the included
buildings within the PED being from a different use typology such as residential, work,

Sustainability 2021, 13, 710

commercial, or recreational. Nevertheless, these were the requirements for this specific
funding call, not a rule imposed by the concept itself. Although they could be taken as a
reference, cities may have different contexts that may lead to different PED categories (also

Other simple calculation procedures were followed in the literature, such as the
heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) methodology. First, the heat
loss coefficient (in W/K) of the building is calculated as a result of the heat gains (internal,
solar heat gains, etc.) and the losses due to heat transfer by transmission (dependent on
the U value of the buildings) and ventilation. Then, the HDD and CDD are calculated,
which estimate how many days within a year the temperature of the building is under (for
heating) or above (for cooling) a certain reference level (i.e., outside temperature at which
people start to use heating or cooling appliances). By multiplying these two values, the
energy needs can be estimated [26]:
BENH&C = BLC∗24∗DD

(2)

where BENH&C is building energy needs (kWh), BLC is the overall building heat loss
coefficient (kW/K), and DD is the degree days (K·d).
More detailed methodologies for calculating the energy needs use energy modelling
tools such as Energy+ [27], or specific national calculation tools developed in most countries
for compliance with building regulations (e.g., HULC in Spain [28]).
With regards to the DHW energy needs, EN15316-3-1 presents several ways to estimate
it. For example, it can be calculated assuming a linear relationship between the volume of
water to be heated and the square meters of the building, or by estimating it with tabulated
values for different types of buildings (relating area and DHW energy needs). Thus, the
DHW needs can be defined by the following equation:
TENDHW = M∗Spec DHW

(3)

where TENDHW is the domestic hot water needs, M is the floor area of the building (m2 ) or
the number of people in the building, and SpecDHW is the specific energy demand to cover
DHW needs.
The parameters in Equation (3) are the floor area of the building in m2 (or number of
people in the building, depending on the data provided by the national standards), and
the specific energy demand in kWh/unit to cover DHW needs. The latter one sometimes
can be found in some national standards. In Spain, residential DHW needs are estimated
to be from 420 to 573 kWh/year per tenant, whereas in hospitals it depends on the beds
(1050 kWh/year/bed) and in sport centers on the users (477 kWh/year/user) [29]. Tools
such as the CREST demand model [30] or DHWcalc [31] can be used for residential buildings to generate DHW profiles with statistical means per minute. Table 1 summarizes some
specific energy needs for different uses. Again, specific national calculation tools developed
for compliance with building regulations also provide calculations of DHW demands.
2.2.2. Electric Energy Needs
“Electric energy needs” are understood as the electricity delivered to cover the energy
demand for the lighting and ventilation of a building. Usually “electric energy needs” and
“electric energy use” by the building for lighting and ventilation purposes are the same, as
losses are usually omitted [21]. Electrical energy to drive the heating system (such as heat
pumps or electrical heaters) and auxiliary elements (pumps, etc.) should be included as
energy use. On the contrary, the heating or cooling output from the heat pump to cover the
space heating and space cooling needs are included in the thermal energy needs.
The energy use of appliances is difficult to quantify and predict, as it depends a lot on
the occupants’ behavior and preferences [32]. The CREST demand model [30] can be used
to determine the electric energy use of appliances within a day (and can be extrapolated to a
year) depending on the number of electrical devices (fridges, cookers, television, computer,
etc.) and occupancy levels estimated by statistical means. Appliances are not considered as
part of the services included in the assessment of the energy performance and thus, not
calculated [21]. But its energy consumption can contribute significantly to the performance
gap between the predicted and actual energy consumption of the building, and thus to the

Sustainability 2021, 13, 710

8 of 19

performance of the positive energy balance of the district. If appliances are excluded, when
evaluating a PED, monitoring shall allow the loads to be measured separately to calculate
the PED performance with and without appliances.
The electric energy needs can be estimated with the following equation:

and 5.5 for a ventilation system with heat recovery [33]).

Using values from Table 2, the electric energy needs for the district are the sum of the
electric energy needs for ventilation and for lighting:
EEN(vent.+light.) = EENvent. + EENligth.

(5)

2.3. Step 3: Calculate the Energy Use
To cover the energy needs, distribution systems, emitters (such as fan coils, radiators,
etc.), storage tanks, and heat exchangers are used. To take into account all the losses, from
the generation system to the energy needs (DHW, SH, SC) of a building, some typical
efficiencies can be considered. The efficiency transforms “energy needs” into “energy use”:
EU =

TEN
ηemitter

(6)

where TEN is calculated according to Section 2.2.1 and transformed to TEU considering the
efficiency (η) of the emitters. Typically, heat exchangers have a conversion efficiency from
the primary stream (source) to the secondary stream (sink) of 70%, but it might be higher or
lower depending on many factors, such as the area of heat transmission. Heat distribution
losses by pipes and storage can vary a lot, from 5% for systems with high insulation to
20% if thinner insulation is installed. TABULA estimates losses of 14.7 kWh/m2 /year with
buffer storage losses, 20.5 kWh/m2 /year for central heating with a pipeline inside of the
thermal envelope, and 36.4 kWh/m2 /year for central heating with a fraction of the pipeline
outside of the thermal envelope [33]. The thermal energy use can also be identified as the
useful energy output from the thermal generation systems (e.g., solar thermal collectors,
boilers, thermal output from CHP, etc.). Detailed information on how to calculate the
energy uses is presented in standard EN15316-3:2017.
Electric energy use can also be identified as the useful energy output from the electric
generation systems, but there may be a slight difference between the energy use by the
appliances and lighting and the energy produced, as part of the electric energy will be lost
in the form of heat. Nevertheless, most of the time this energy loss is very small and can be
omitted, so for ventilation and lighting it could be said that:
EEU(vent.+light.) ∼
= EEN(vent.+light.)

(7)

If a heat pump (HP) or an electric resistance is used to cover the SH/SC needs or
DHW, its seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP for SH and DHW) and its seasonal

Sustainability 2021, 13, 710

9 of 19

energy efficiency ratio for cooling (SEERSC ) could be used to estimate the electric energy
use. Thus, the total electric energy use of the district is the sum of the ventilation, lighting,
and electricity required for SH/SC and DHW:
TENSH
TENSC
TENDHW
EEU(vent+light+HP) ∼
+
+
= EEU(vent+light) +
SCOPSH
SEERSC
SCOPDHW

(8)

The COP of HPs largely depends on the temperature to be delivered, the mode (heating
or cooling), and the temperature of the source. For example, for a WWHP producing 55 ◦ C
for DHW with a ground temperature of 15 ◦ C, the COP may be around 3.16, whereas
if it produces water at 35 ◦ C, the COP increases up to 6.30. For this same heat pump, if
producing cooling at 7 ◦ C with an outdoor air temperature of 35 ◦ C, the EER is reduced
to 2.73 [34].
In the MAKING-CITY calculation methodology electricity used within the district
boundaries for domestic appliances and mobility (traffic lights, road lights, EV cars, etc.)
are omitted. In commercial and industrial buildings, the corresponding standards should
be taken into account, but usually all energy use for processes and for the services provided
by a commercial or tertiary activity should be considered. Nevertheless, it is left open
that a PED can elect the elements and prepare a specific calculation, as long as it is clearly
reported as displayed in Figure 3.
2.4. Step 4: Calculate the on-Site Generation
The following step in the PED calculation is to consider different supply side solutions
to cover energy needs [35]. After selecting which solutions will be considered for a certain
district, energy systems can be listed, and the connections between each of them (schematics) as well as the energy sources supplying the PED (biogas, natural gas, solar, wind,
electricity from the grid, etc.) can be identified. Table 3 shows the energy flows depending
on different supply side solutions. Several systems could be used in combination, so
different energy flows should be considered. The energy carrier fed into the generation
systems can come from on-site renewable energy sources (within the boundaries) or from
the outside (incoming energy) when electricity from the grid or biomass is consumed. RES
are considered local (or on-site) generation in the MAKING-CITY calculation methodology
(i.e., within the boundaries of the district). Waste heat is also considered a renewable source
in most of the literature, as this heat would otherwise be wasted [36]. Heat pumps with a
SCOP higher than 2.5 are considered a renewable source according to ISO52000, but in this
methodology what is done is to consider the driving source of the heat pump as energy
use (in Equation (8)) instead of local on-site production.
The idea in this phase is to identify which energy uses will be covered by RES (numbers
1 and 2 in Figure 5) and maximize its capacity to cover as much as possible with it. As
Figure 5 shows, the higher the thermal energy coming from RES and waste heat, the lower
the dependency from a non-RES system such as a boiler. If the latter one is used, a fuel
input is required (number 4 in Figure 5) that can come from a non-RES source (such as
natural gas). In the case of electricity, the energy uses can be covered by electric RES, a
CHP, or the electricity from the grid (numbers 2 and 3 in Figure 5, respectively). In the case
of the heat pump, it can be seen that it is accounted as EEU, which produces heating or
cooling to cover the needs.

uses, and energy delivered.

Thus, the useful RES thermal energy produced from hybrid photovoltaic-thermal
panels (TEPPVTth ), a biomass-fuelled CHP (TEPCHPbio,th ), and a direct exchange with a
geothermal source (TEPgeo ), among others, can be calculated as follows:
TEPRES =

∑ TEPPVTth + TEPCHPbio,th + TEPgeo + · · ·

(9)

Sustainability 2021, 13, 710

11 of 19

The biomass used in the CHP should be considered in step 5. The useful RES electricity
generated on site from PVT panels (EEPPVTel ), from PV panels (EEPPV ), and from a biomassfueled CHP can be calculated as follows:
EEPRES =

∑ EEPPVTel + EEPPV + TEPCHPbio,el + · · ·

(10)

Biomass used in the CHP should be only accounted for once in Section 2.5. Knowing
the energy uses that need to be covered by each RES system gives an idea of its needed
useful output and, using an efficiency, the required installed capacity to cover the needs.
In [37], the efficiency values at full load for different energy systems were evaluated. The
efficiency mean values were near 100% for condensing boilers and electric radiators, from
85% to 90% for solar thermal unglazed collectors, from 75% to 80% for non-condensing
boilers, around 60% for flat-plate and evacuated tube collectors, and 50% for electric stoves.
The DH system had a mean heat loss for EU28 of 13.70%. The mean capacity per equipment
in EU28 was presented in [37], varying from 5 kW to aerothermal heat pumps and stoves,
20 kW for condensing and non-condensing boilers, and up to 200 kW for combined heatpower units (CHP) [37]. The district heating mean value exceeded the capacities (reaching
a number of almost 75,000 kW [37]) but the maximum capacities in small houses were
actually 60 kW for DWW and 20 kW for heating [38]. If SH and DHW are centralized, they
can reach much more depending on use and demand.
2.5. Step 5: Calculate the Energy Delivered
The energy delivered is known as the energy supplied to the PED (per energy carrier)
that is produced outside the district boundaries. Usually it comes from thermal, gas, or
electric grids and feeds the energy systems available on site in the district.
With the useful outputs calculated in step 4, the remaining energy to be covered
by non-renewable energy sources (e.g., natural gas-driven boilers) or by external grids
(e.g., electricity or DHN) was identified. To do so, the thermal energy produced from
RES (TEPRES ) and the thermal energy use (TEU) are compared. If the difference is greater
than zero, there is remaining energy to be covered by non-RES or by a district heating
system. For both, the energy delivered (ED) to the PED should be considered. If instead
the difference is lower than zero, there is an amount of thermal energy exported outside
the limits of the PED (which can be called a surplus of thermal energy):
STE = TEU − TEPRES

(11)

The same applies for the surplus of electric energy:
SEE = EEU − EEPRES

(12)

In the case that the SEE is higher than zero, the electricity needed can come from the
power electricity grid. Greater energy consumption over renewable energy generation
within the boundary indicates an import (in) from outside the boundary (i.e., STE > 0 or
SEE > 0). Greater renewable energy generation within the boundary over energy import
from outside the boundary indicates an export (out) to outside the boundary (i.e., STE < 0
or SEE < 0).
Even if the STE is lower than zero, the incoming energy to boilers or CHP systems that
use biomass is usually considered a renewable source coming from outside the boundaries
(thus, it is delivered to the PED). That incoming energy (to be used by biomass boilers or
CHP boilers) needs to be accounted for as well. For example, the energy delivered (ED) by
a CHP using biomass is:
TEPCHPbio,th
EDCHP =
(13)
ηCHPbio,th
The EDCHP is the biomass energy needed to produce the required heat (TEPCHPbio,th ).
The ED of the CHP is only accounted for once as the CHP produces both electricity and heat

Sustainability 2021, 13, 710

12 of 19

using the same input. Both the output and input of each system are linked with a source of
energy inside or outside the boundary for each energy carrier. The total ED is accounted
for separately per energy carrier, such as natural gas, peat, biomass, electricity from the
grid, oil, etc. The imported energy (or ED) and exported energy are then transformed to
primary energy in step 6 per energy carrier.
2.6. Step 6: Calculate the Primary Energy Equivalent
Primary energy is the energy that has not undergone any conversion in the transformation process, calculated by the energy carrier using the primary energy factors (PEF). In the
MAKING-CITY methodology non-renewable primary energy factors (PEFnren ) are used.
Usually the non-renewable primary energy factor for the electricity exported is considered
the same as the grid’s non-renewable primary energy factor since a substitution assumption
is made, meaning that by exporting it, the exports avoid this amount of electricity in the
national energy mix. The same thing happens with the heat exported to district heating.
The “delivered energy” per energy carrier is transformed into primary energy as follows:

•

Primary energy imported (PEI) is calculated as the sum of the weighted delivered
energy over all energy carriers (electric energy drawn from the grid, gas from the grid,
oil, or pellets—all multiplied by their respective PEFnren ).
PEI =

∑ Delivered energy per energy carrier ∗ PEFnren per energy carrier

(14)

It accounts for the energy supplied to the district that is produced outside the district limits.

•

Primary energy exported (PEE) is calculated as the sum of the weighted exported
energy over all energy carriers.
PEE =

∑ Exported energy per energy carrier ∗ PEFnren per energy carrier

(15)

It is the surplus of energy delivered by the district that is used outside the system boundary.
PEFs are the ratio of a given type of primary energy (renewable, non-renewable, and
total as the addition of both) to the actual energy amount. On the one hand, if only nonrenewable primary energy is taken into account in the analysis, non-renewable primary
energy factors (PEFnren ) are used. This methodology recommends calculating the PED
balance in non-RES primary energy terms using PEFnren , as if total primary energy factors
(TPEF) are used it could hamper the use of some RES, such as biomass from forest waste
that would be an import to the PED. TPEF is the sum of the PEFnren and renewable primary
energy factor (PEFren ):
TPEF = PEFnren + PEFren
(16)
PEFs, whether TPEF or PEFnren , are usually a constant national value, and do not
depend on time or geographical location. However, they depend on the specific mix of
primary energy sources and the efficiency of the processes of transformation, generation,
storage, and transportation, which are temporally dependent factors [39]. PEFren for RES
are a bit more intricate. Finland considers PEFren zero in their calculations [40,41], whereas
Spain [42] and Germany [43] do not. Waste heat can be seen as a renewable source (with a
PEFren of 1) that is used to reduce the heat input, as this heat would otherwise be wasted [36].
For biomass, PEFren can depend on its regrowth rate [44], such as peat that is considered
non-RES since it accumulates on the land with a low carbon sequestration yield [45]. For
renewable sources such as PV or wind, some countries consider the non-renewable energy
used during the maintenance process of these plants (hence, its PEFnren is similar to 0.05).
For the present methodology, as the balance is calculated on annual basis, national primary
energy factors are recommended. Nevertheless, if some factors cannot be found, the ISO
52000 standard provides a table with default total non-renewable and renewable primary
energy factors [46].

renewable source weighted using non-renewable primary energy factors (PEFnren ).
In addition, the avoided energy as a result of injecting PV into the grid is considered
(using PEFnren,GRID ).
PEnren = ∑ Delivered energy per energy carrier ∗ PEFnren,ENERGY CARRIER − Exported energy PV ∗ PEFnren,GRID
−Exported energy Biogas ∗ PEFnren,GAS · · · etc.

(18)

This should be equal to the MAKING-CITY PED balance (Equation (17)), as only
PEFnren are considered.

•

PEren is the renewable primary energy consumed at the energy facility. It is calculated
per energy carrier. Renewables coming from the grid are also considered:

PEren = ∑ Delivered energy per energy carrier ∗ PEFren,ENERGY CARRIER − Exported energy PV ∗ PEFren,GRID
−Exported energy Biogas ∗ PEFren,GAS · · · ETC

(19)

The sum of the two terms from above is the total primary energy balance:
PED BalanceTOTAL terms = PEnren + PEren

(20)

This can give an idea of how efficient a district is.
Furthermore, if the city wants to assess how much renewable energy has been delivered to the PED, the renewable energy factor is calculated as follows:
RER =

PEren
PED BalanceTOTAL terms

(21)

Finally, the net carbon dioxide equivalent emissions can be calculated as the difference between the total equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2eq ) of the imported
primary energy and the total equivalent emissions that have been avoided by exporting
the RES produced.
CO2 eqB =

∑ PEI per energy carrier ∗ CO2eq emission factor − ∑ PEE per energy carrier ∗ CO2eq emission factor

(22)

Care should be taken calculating this, as most of the CO2eq emission factors are in
terms of delivered energy or final energy (not primary energy). In this case it is calculated
with the net non-renewable primary energy. Therefore, the emission factor to be used is in
terms of non-renewable primary energy, too.
3. Discussion—Shortcomings of the Proposed Methodology
The methodology proposed a process to calculate a PED energy balance based on
primary energy. On the one hand, the accuracy that can be required for the energy balance
calculations of the PED is debatable. Calculation of energy needs and energy use within
the buildings and public spaces at the design stage needs a lot of estimations, and it can
lead to over- and underestimations of what will really be demanded. For instance, in a
MAKING-CITY project the calculation of the energy use of the building is simplified (and
by extension the district) and appliances are not considered.
On the other hand, EU member states (MS) have different approaches when accounting
for the RES requirements for the energy performance of buildings (such as the NZEB).
Some technologies, such as solar thermal panels for domestic hot water generation and for
heating, PV for self-use, biomass boilers, and heat pumps coupled with external air, exhaust
air, ground, or ground water, can in general be accounted for in the energy performance
calculation in all 24 countries [47]. However, PV for feed-in, RES as part of a district
cooling network or micro-wind turbines (for both: self-use or feed-in), and local hydro
power for self-use can be accounted for in the energy performance calculation in about
half of the EU MS. The RES technologies that can most rarely be accounted for in energy

local hydro power for feed-in. In principle, PEDs should use an approach closer to the
national codes where the PED is applied, but accounting additionally for the energy that
is exported, as is followed in this article (otherwise, it would be very difficult to achieve
a PED). However, as MS do not have a harmonized way to calculate energy balances, in
some countries the implementation of PEDs could be jeopardized and it could be difficult
to compare them. For example, in Spanish DB-HE2019 regulations non-renewable energy
flows can be only compensated with energy exports within the same month. This means,
for example, that the excess PV energy exported during the months of summer cannot
compensate the non-renewable energy consumption from the months of winter. This is
a barrier for implementing PEDs in Spain, and relates to the calculation timestep used in
the PED calculations. Although in this paper an annual energy balance was considered,
shorter timesteps add complexity to the calculation. Monthly, daily, hourly, or sub-hourly
simulations can be a further addition to the methodology whenever it is necessary to assess
the role of PEDs on the flexibility of the energy system.
Finally, barriers to the technology implementation and refurbishment of buildings are
high, especially in existing districts. CA EPBD work on national applications of the NZEB
definition has shown that MS see a specific challenge in “how to include RES contributions
to the energy supply of multi-family houses in city centres, where roof areas and other
suitable areas for the installation of RES technologies (e.g., the ground around the buildings)
are limited in comparison with the buildings’ floor area and are often shaded by other
buildings” [47]. The EU project POCITYF will demonstrate 10 integrated solutions in
cultural heritage areas that are usually difficult to refurbish due to the cultural value of
their façades. Thus, there is still a gap in the different barriers that could be found in
different urban contexts and how to overcome them.
4. Conclusions
This paper establishes an eight-step guideline on how to calculate the annual energy
balance of a district. The methodology is meant for districts aspiring to become PEDs,
which need to demonstrate that a positive energy balance is achieved. Although many
assumptions are required depending on district, region, or country context (such as PEFs),
the methodology proposed could help the cities at the design stage of establishing a district
and to evaluate its annual energy balance.
Currently, there is no standard to calculate an energy balance applied at the district
level, and the energy flows between the buildings and energy systems are very casespecific and sometimes complex to understand. On the other hand, standards can help
but are not that user-friendly. Therefore, the developed methodology proposes an energy
balance calculation as a “first step” to standardize the process and to provide a clear
calculation procedure. The proposed calculation makes different assumptions on how
the boundaries are defined and how to calculate the district balance despite most of
them still being under discussion in most of the relevant scientific forums. Appliances,
mobility, occupants’ behavior, and building automation systems are not considered in these
calculation procedures (not known at the design stage), but when considered, it could
improve the results between the predicted and actual energy uses of the district and lead
to a more accurate design to achieve a positive energy balance. In the future, integration
of different sectors and energy vectors (such as industry and hydrogen), should also be
considered. Furthermore, seasonal and even simultaneous operation of PEDs and the
impact and stress that the grid can suffer should be studied.
Because it is possible to achieve a Positive Energy District through an unrealistic
system (as huge on-site generation, to give an example), a standardized calculation is
needed similar to the NZEB rating, where lowering the energy needs is a first requisite to
certifying the building (and by extension a district).
Finally, the developed methodology will be the basis for energy balance calculations
for lighthouse cities in the MAKING-CITY project, and the verification of this methodology
once the real project demo sites are finished and evaluated.

Description
A Positive Energy District is an urban area with clear boundaries, consisting of
buildings of different typologies that actively manage the energy flow between them
and the larger energy system to reach an annual positive non-renewable primary energy
balance. Non-renewable primary energy imported to the district is lower than the
equivalent avoided non-renewable primary energy (due to RES exports outside the
district limits).
Systems using solar energy, wind farms (owned by the district), geothermal,
hydropower, heat pumps (with COP > 2.5), and systems using local biomass or biogas
are local on-site renewable energy sources. Waste heat facilities are considered local
on-site renewable sources. In the case of biogas and biomass, a non-renewable primary
energy factor is used to transform the biogas/biomass energy delivered into primary
energy, i.e., accounting for the energy needed to process and obtain these fuels.
Heat to be delivered to or extracted by emitters (radiators, fan coils, etc.) to cover the
energy demands of the buildings and thermal conditioned spaces to maintain the
intended space temperature conditions during a given period of time [21]
Heat to be delivered to the needed amount of domestic hot water to raise its
temperature from the cold network temperature (usually known as tap water) to the
prefixed delivered temperature (different for each country and system) at the delivery
point, accounting for the losses [21]
Electric energy to be delivered to cover the energy demand of lighting and ventilation of
a building. Usually electric energy needs and electric energy use by the building for
lighting and ventilation purposes are the same (losses can be neglected). Electrical
energy to drive the heating system (such as heat pumps or electrical heaters) and
auxiliary elements (pumps, etc.) should be included as energy use [21]
Energy input into the heating, cooling, or hot water system to satisfy the thermal energy
needs for heating, cooling, or hot water, respectively. It can also be identified as the
useful energy output from the thermal generation systems (e.g., solar thermal collectors,
boilers, thermal output from CHP, etc.). [21]

Description
Electric energy directly consumed by buildings (from grid or local RES as PV, wind, etc.)
to be delivered to cover the energy needs (for DHW, heating, and cooling when an
electricity-driven system is used; and ventilation and lighting). Only electric energy
needs and uses in the EPB standards are considered, therefore the electricity used
within the district boundaries for domestic appliances and mobility (traffic lights, road
lights, EV cars, etc.) are neglected [21]. In commercial and industrial buildings, the
corresponding standards should be taken into account. Note that electric energy use can
also be identified as the useful energy output from the electric generation systems.
There might be a slight difference between the energy use by the building and the
electric energy needs by appliances due to the loss of energy by means of heat, which is
usually neglected, as it is smaller than the overall consumption. Electric energy to drive
the heating system (such as heat pumps or electrical heaters) and auxiliary elements
(pumps, etc.) should be included as electric energy use.
Thermal energy generated by the systems located on site in the district from RES. The
energy carrier used in these systems should be considered in order to know the amount
of energy delivered to the PED (e.g., biomass imported, etc.).
Electricity generated by any system located on site in the district from RES. All the
energy carriers used in these systems should be considered in order to know the
amount of energy delivered to the PED (e.g., biomass imported, etc.).
The thermal energy produced on site that is not used to cover thermal energy needs and
therefore is exported outside the district boundaries. It is calculated as the difference
between thermal energy produced on site and thermal energy used on site.
The electricity produced on site that is not used to cover electricity needs and therefore
is exported outside the district boundaries. It is calculated as the difference between the
electricity produced on site and electric energy used on site.
Energy supplied to the PED (thermal, fuels, and electricity) that comes from outside the
district boundaries [21].
The primary energy balance is calculated as the difference between energy delivered to
the district (sum of all energy carriers) multiplied by the non-renewable primary energy
factor (per energy carrier) and the energy that is exported outside the PED’s boundaries
multiplied by the non-renewable primary energy factor (per energy carrier).
This factor indicates how much primary energy (renewable and non-renewable) is used
to generate a unit of electricity or a unit of useable thermal energy (commonly applied
to fuels). This electricity comes usually from the grid, and in that case, it is a country
specific indicator and depends on the country’s energy mix [21].
The non-renewable primary energy factor (PEFnren ) proves or shows how much
primary energy from non-renewable sources is used to generate a unit of final energy
through the use of consumption indicators [21].
The renewable primary energy factor (PEFren ) proves or shows how much primary
energy from renewable sources is used to generate a unit of final energy through the use
of consumption indicators.
Surplus of non-renewable primary energy delivered by the PED that is used outside the
district boundaries. It is calculated as the sum of the surplus of thermal energy
multiplied by non-renewable primary energy factors (taking into account the different
energy carriers) and the surplus of electric energy multiplied by non-renewable primary
energy factors (taking into account the grid electricity factors). The non-renewable
primary energy factors of the grids (gas, electricity, fuels, etc.) are used in order to take
into account the “avoided” energy of the system beyond the boundaries.
Energy delivered into the PED that is calculated in terms of non-renewable primary
energy as the sum of the weighted delivered energy over all energy carriers (electric
energy drawn from the grid, heat from a district heating network, gas from the grid, oil,
biomass, biogas, or any other fuel) multiplied by the non-renewable primary energy
factors of each energy carrier.
