Abstract: In accordance with the new recovery plan, Next Generation EU (NGEU), and the need to
speed up the transition of cities towards a new sustainable model, this paper provides an overview
of the outcomes of the PEDRERA project, which is focused on the development of a novel tool able
to calculate multiple key performance indicators that can support renovation actions at the district
level, according to a Positive Energy District (PED) concept. The new tool is programmed in Python
programming language and is useful to evaluate several strategies for the renovation of existing
building stock. It moves from a quick list of input according to several Public Private Partnership
(PPP) models, in addition to other potential business models. Furthermore, the design of the model
is supported by a step-by-step methodology in order to deal with a “financial appraisal” that is
interactive in each context, customizable for each stakeholder, and user-friendly. The paper describes
this innovative tool and reports on the stronger potential that this model can offer when it runs in a
QGIS software environment and interacts with a PostgreSQL database, as demonstrated in two case
studies located in Spain.

1. Introduction

Academic Editors: Eduardo José

The European Commission’s commitment to energy renovation of building stock and
energy sufficiency in the Member States is growing stronger all the time, even more so
after the COVID-19 pandemic, and is extremely urgent now due to the war in Ukraine.
This ambition was previously revealed in the content and details included in the long-term
renovation strategy of Article 2(a) of Directive 2010/31/EU [1,2], following the publication
of Directive 2018/844/EU. In addition, this effort is also disclosed in the Green Deal presented by the Commission at the beginning of 2020, in which the “Renovation Wave” plays
a leading role [3,4].
According to both the Green Deal and the Renovation Wave objective of making the EU
climate-neutral by 2050, and considering the strategy proposed in the Next Generation EU
recovery Plan [5], the European Commission aims to at least double renovation rates in the
next 10 years, and make sure renovations lead to higher energy and resource efficiency [3].
To decarbonise the European economy, the European Green Deal, together with the Mission
on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities, have set ambitious energy and climate targets [1,6] to
reduce Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions and energy vulnerability, and to improve the
reuse and recycling of materials. At the same time, the new adopted strategies will enhance
the renewable energy sufficiency and the quality of life for people living in and using
the buildings. In addition, studies confirm that 35 million buildings could be renovated
by 2030, and up to 160,000 additional green jobs could be created in the construction
sector [4]. Nevertheless, only 1% of buildings undergo energy efficient renovation every

year, so effective action is crucial in order to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050 [7].
Promoting a series of strategies and solutions is therefore strongly recommended, which
would allow work on the built environment with systemic approaches and the integration
of stakeholders involved in the process [8–10]. Indeed, this approach aims to develop an
innovative ecosystem, based on an integrated co-creation process in which cooperation
between multiple stakeholders, and their engagement, are both common strengths of the
transformation actions of the urban context. In this sense, business models that support the
concrete implementation of renewal interventions are encouraged—e.g., One-Stop-Shops
(OSS), Turnkeys and Public–Private Partnership (PPP) models [8,11–13]. In this context, the
Positive Energy District (PED) is currently considered as one of the pioneering strategies
to guide cities in their energy planning process towards climate neutrality in the next few
years. Considering PEDs as one of the three pillars of the Driving Urban Transition (DUT)
Partnership [14], should also be recognized. PEDs are part of the planned decarbonization
of European urban areas, combining high energy efficiency with the production and
use of renewables, ramped up to create sustainable smart cities [15]. In addition, the
mainstreaming and implementation of PED models in cities, constitutes a very powerful
engine of investment, growth, and employment, which could significantly promote the
activation of a large rehabilitation of the national building stock, with much greater impact
in the market. At the same time, as proposed by the European Commission, it will help
meet the objective of 3% in annual rehabilitation, and expand energy citizenship [16].
Energy democracy and energy citizenship are keywords in this future strategy. Both are
political, social, and cultural concepts tightly connected to an increased awareness of the
need for a rapid, but also fair and inclusive, energy transition [17].
Although different studies and practical experiences on PEDs are focusing on newly
built districts, it is necessary to urgently undertake a transformation process of existing
districts, in a sustainable and climate-neutral direction [18]. Several ongoing works, initiatives, and research—e.g., COST Action PED-EU-NET, JP Urban Europe, IEA Annex 83
PED, etc.—are addressing the systematization of enabling factors, stakeholders and lessons
learnt by mapping PEDs experiences abroad, and by designing an advanced database.
Moreover, they are focused on the creation of structured repositories of information and
data, aiming at driving urban transformations across the whole complexity of urban challenges, empowering the creation of capacity and community building as key aspects of the
decision-making process, implementation, and replication of PEDs [19,20]. Thus, gathering
data in a systemized database is one of the main methodologies adopted to assess and
monitor multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), supporting the whole process and/or
promoting replication. Still, further, there are many barriers, both technological and nontechnological (i.e., political/regulatory, economic, social), and most existing frameworks
are not yet methodologically sound, which means that KPIs, system boundaries, targets,
and business plan are not always clearly defined or addressed [21,22].
The economic and financial aspects of achieving sustainability and decarbonization by
2050 are not the only barriers of the renovation process, and the lack of clarity on how to
afford home renovation is often a good reason for leaving the project. [23–25]. Furthermore,
a stakeholder, e.g., the end-users, will only use the Renovation Wave if the renovation
process is feasible, simplified, quick and cheap for them. For these reasons, the most
challenging objective is to deal with the complexity of the energy renovation process, while
reducing uncertainties regarding costs and time. Hence, it is the lack of certainty of a
successful outcome and business model, together with the likely delays on delivery of
renovated buildings, which can be considered as the most worrying aspects in this regard,
and which make people unwilling to risk investment. Consequently, at an early stage,
these aspects represent the first barriers for end-users, as well as for private investors and
Public Administration, which are asked to engage in these large actions, especially when
targeting renovation programmes on a district scale [26]. In cases where investment is
very high, and access to external financing sources is mandatory, this usually consists
of favorable loans (potentially subsidized), as well as public grants and revolving funds

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

for vulnerable people [27,28]. Usually, economic and financial details are progressively
refined as technical choices and costs are clarified. However, given the lack of capacity of
homeowners to cope with the complexity and technicality of renovation schemes, energy
renovation can only be upscaled if appropriate services and new PPP participants (e.g.,
General Contractors, Turnkey, etc.) are put in place on the supply side, in order to decrease
the burden of renovation.
2. The PEDRERA Model’s Tool and Methodology
As explained above, the different strategies and plans promoted by the EU are not only
focused on making existing buildings more energy efficient and climate neutral: namely,
they can trigger an additional large-scale transformation and impact on our perception of
cities and built environment [29]. Hence, the district is the right scale to be considered to
start a forward-looking process matching sustainability with health and inclusion, while
fostering economic growth and creating jobs in the next years. [30,31]. For all these reasons,
advanced knowledge is required from the initial stage of the process to overcome other
uncertainties and criticalities that are related to both the state and consistency of the
building, and the affordability of end users. According to all these premises, the PEDRERA
model has been designed to provide a coordinated and coherent response to the needs of
the three main stakeholders considered in the process: end-users, the Public Sector, and
Private Parties. Furthermore, at each step of their customer journey, the criticalities and
potentialities from each stakeholder have been studied, thus making the renovation process
as feasible as possible [11].
The work carried out by the PEDRERA project has been focused on developing a
model able to support and boost energy retrofitting projects at large scale that are based on
different energy conservation and active measures aiming at improving the behavior and
sustainability of a district [32]. On the other hand, the PEDRERA model moves from the
idea that both the aggregation of the demand side (the needs) and the intervention scale
allow the reduction of the expenses and general costs of the intervention process together
with other economies of scale. Due to the complexity and the large number of aspects
and administrative barriers that must be resolved in this type of process (e.g., vertical and
horizontal property, building consistency, building regulations or the technical building
code), the estimation of financial and economic effort together with the collaborations
between all local actors (SMEs, financial institutions, energy agencies or private investors,
entities, and PAs, etc.) are crucial elements for the success of these large-scale transformation
processes. Hence, the cities and communities, in cooperation with local financial institutions
and investors, can help to overcome these shortcomings by developing user-customized
financial products and models—e.g., PPP models—and adopting innovative services—e.g.,
One-Stop Shop (OSS)—or Turnkeys solutions which allow the investment to be more
attractive, more agile, and adapted for different types of owners and for different types of
buildings, and with economic conditions that are more reliable and profitable [10].
To reach this objective, the project team has created a new tool able to reduce the time
delivery and tackle the uncertainties of most usual business models. Indeed, the PEDRERA
tool represents a very operative solution to accomplish several lead goals:

•
•
•

•

Embracing accessibility and well-targeted funding streams, as well as multiple incentives for private financing.
Supporting the very beginning activities of One-Stop Shops and Turnkeys models for
building renovation at large scale.
Increasing the capacity building and the implementation of renovation projects by
reducing uncertainties to regional and local authorities (Public Sector) and private
investors (Private Parties) as well.
Developing neighborhood-based approaches for local communities to integrate renewable energy production and digital solutions dealing with zero-energy districts.

According to these objectives and ideas, the PEDRERA project led to the design of
a tool able to set up and analyze a reliable prediction of potential business scenarios on

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

large-scale retrofitting actions and to evaluate the overall co-benefits deriving from the
renovation process of a group of buildings at the district level. Therefore, the designed
framework of the model is systematized in a way that the information database is collected
in a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) environment, and then data are used to
forecast and manage, from the very early stage, the feasibility of a large-scale project thanks
to the tool algorithms programmed in Python. Then, the tool has been tested and validated
in two demonstration districts located in Spain: Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Palma
de Mallorca.
2.1. PEDRERA Model Input
The PEDRERA model is designed as a multidisciplinary tool that starts from the
aggregation and systematization of several gathered information (input) at the building
scale in a semiautomatic way. Once all the information is collected, then the model engine
returns a set of multiple features (output) related to the adopted parameters and renovation
measures that have been aggregated and stated for the district-scale intervention. These
input and output are organized according to different categories and KPIs that include
economic, technological, and non-technological aspects, namely issues [32].
The model methodology is based on two pillars: (1) the creation of a database by
collecting a wide range of information and data available from cadaster (cadastral code,
type and functions of the buildings, age, properties rate) and other sources, and (2) the
integration of these primary inputs with the other queries, thus allowing the final design of
the intervention within the innovative engineered tool. The interoperability of input within
the model regards three stages of integration:
1.

2.

3.

The aggregation of semantic data from cadaster with data mapping processes in
GIS environment to ensure interoperability to the model among different platform
components and consistency of communications.
The adoption of Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) and Active measures from a
database of technical solutions that, according to the physical consistency of selected
buildings on GIS map, return information on design, intervention costs, energy
upscale and potential subsidies achievable from Next Generation EU programs.
The integration of the results from the previous step as input to be enclosed in the
financial and business model engine, thus allowing the design of several large-scale
scenarios and finally the implementation of the selected one.

The input collection represents the first key activity of the adopted methodology
deployed in the PEDRERA project, and follows a multiparametric approach as shown in
Figure 1 that involves three matching processes referring to the above-mentioned stages:

•

•

•

Stage 1: Gathering information from multiple sources of data available in a database
(i.e., open data as the national cadaster) based on a GIS environment (PostgresSQL)
for clustering and characterizing each building.
Stage 2: Applying measures and cadastral data to the selected buildings (Table 1) for
economic appraisal and cost analysis across the two so-called PEDRERAs: “Extra Core
programming model 1” and “Extra Core programming model 2”.
Stage 3: Importing input as CSV files in the designed wizard of the “Core programming
module” to enhance the business model scenarios, and to compare and definitively
select the most suitable.

The “Extra Core programming module 1” (ECpm1) has been designed to collect
data from the selection of buildings on the GIS Map and includes all the information
available from cadaster. Data are imported as CSV from PostgresSQL and systemized in
“Building Attributes”, “Architectural Characteristic”, “Cost Analysis”, and “User Type”.
Once imported, all the gathered information in ECp1 can be adopted also in the “Extra
Core programming 2” (ECpm2), where both passive and active “Renovation Measures”
are implemented on the selected buildings on GIS for a more detailed “Cost Analysis” at
building scale. Hence, the analysis in the ECpm2 is focused on applying several intervention
menus to each selected building to assess the economic effort (“PEC”) and achievable funds
(“Grants%”) from each building to be considered in the “Cost Analysis” and “Business
Model” design within the “Core programming module” (Cpm). Indeed, the application of
each intervention measure enables us to: (a) define the potential reduction of the energy
demand required to access to the percentage of achievable grants (40, 65, 80%) as stated by
the Spanish Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan regulated by the Real Decreto
RD 853/2021 [33]; and (b) estimate the duration of intervention works required for the
cashflow analysis (“Cash Flow Diagram”) as output of the PEDRERA Cpm. The widespread
knowledge of the building stock is crucial for the development of an effective energy retrofit
aimed at reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and increasing RES
production [34,35]. Regarding to the estimation of (a) the cost of intervention (PEC), (b) the
predictable level of energy efficiency, and (c) the grants obtainable with the retrofit action,
two different methodologies have been applied.
The first method means an indirect, simplified, and quick analysis to be conducted
on the selected buildings, according to the customized clusterization [36,37] and/or the
acknowledged literature [38], by typology (single family/multifamily buildings) and age,
and then applying an average renovation cost for dwellings (EUR/dwelling) to each
type of selected building, according to the literature [39,40]. Otherwise, costs for each
technical solution are imported by available platform [41–44]. The cost and grants analysis
can be calculated without the use of the ECpm2. The characterization of buildings is
incorporated in ECpm1 as CSV file that includes a systemized selection of the “Building
Attributes”, “Architectural Characteristic”, and “User Type” from the entire database
loaded in PostgresSQL. Once buildings are selected on the map, then data are merged in
the module and systematized according to the cadastral reference codes “14” and “20”
provided by the Spanish cadaster. Each code is related to each building and to each
household within the building, respectively. In this way, parametric costs can be applied
taking into account the main information on use (residential, commercial, etc.), typology
(n. of dwellings/premises), and age (construction period). In addition, the “cadastral ref.
code 20” is adopted also to collect the information on the “partition rate (i)” within each
building where the breakdown of expenses is, of a kind, proportional. The weight of these
coefficients is very important for the feasibility of the renovation programme, as also when
the cost of intervention is shared among owners of the same building, because its value may
considerably vary according to the type and size or position of each single unit (dwellings
or premises) in the building.
The second method means a direct estimation and the systemized information on the
selected buildings is imported from ECpm1 according to the “cadastral ref. code 14”. For
this scope, a database with renovation measures has been created to be used in the ECpm2
according to different market-based budget generation sources and taking into account the
most effective solutions that are traditionally adopted in the Spanish retrofit market sector.
The measurement of the building’s consistency—e.g., facade and roof m2 —is carried out
with a very fast survey method based on calculation from numeric and digital information
(i.e., *.dxf, *.shp, *.gml, *.kml format file) available from the Spanish national cadaster web
page [45] and is assigned to each building. In addition, a quick visual ratification from
online platforms allows the geospatial data to be displayed and validated on a map (e.g.,
“3D maps” and “Street View”) [46]. In this way, the data is organized in the ECpm2 and
systematized for each building according to the roof, external vertical walls, and window

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

extensions. Once consistency is collected, renovation measures are applied. Then, the
renovation measures are refereed to each category of the renovation menus (A, B, C) (see
Figure 2) and their cost is evaluated and validated according to consolidated regional
construction costs repositories, i.e., the BEDEC database from the Institut de Tecnologia

Several measures were identified according to each menu of intervention, for windows (aluminum and PVC framing with thermal cut, low emissivity, and standard double
glazing), walls (ETICS—External thermal insulation composite system), and roofs (engineered polyurethane, agglomerated cork, expanded polystyrene), as well as for other active
solutions (BIPV—Building Integrated Photovoltaics and solar panels), equipment (heat
pumps, MVHR—mechanical ventilation and heat recovery, but also elevators if required
for accessibility), and structural improvement solutions (reinforcement, new roof, etc.). For
each efficient measure, information on the physical and thermal properties as well as its
investment costs are collected. Furthermore, the inputs are finalized to provide specific
information for calculating the potential investment KPIs and several other co-benefits to
be achieved through the renewal process, ones that are profitable and/or feasible for the
actors involved in the process; i.e., the prediction of energy demand reduction associated
to each measure and cost of intervention is a key aspect for calculating grants % in the
model, as mentioned above. Indeed, once the collection of input on cost of intervention
(PEC) and on achievable grants is concluded, then an advanced Cost Analysis is performed
in the ECpm1.
The first phase of the financial appraisal is based on the cost analysis obtained with
one of the two methods. In addition, further information and characterization of the User
Types (UTs) is needed to design the entire business model as well as to overcome the
economic vulnerability of some low-income users. Indeed, the “cadastral ref. 20 code”
provides the information on the “partition rate (i)” coefficient, as explained above. The
awareness of the UTs therefore allows the reduction of the monthly fees necessary to cover
the retrofit costs by single users and, at the same time, allows the calculation of the effort
of dedicated public subsidies requested from the Public Administration. Furthermore,
this estimation is functional for the calculation of other relevant business model KPIs,
e.g., the Financial Amount required, the Financial Costs for Private Parties, the Financial
Needs and the Cashflow of the entire renovation process, etc. For the calculation of entire
outputs from the model, additional and customizable inputs are required and, so, they
are programmed within the model. Data are collected in a special wizard panel of the
Cpm programmed in Python. These customizable parameters run together with that data
deriving from the above described ECpm1. The Cpm is designed in a way that data from
ECpm1 can be automatically gathered in Python as .csv file or, if required, the data can
be entered manually without the need of the extra core. The selection and ranking of the
main parameters are based on specific information or the needs of the stakeholders, or as a
requirement of renovation program.
2.2. PEDRERA Model Output
Once inputs are collected from ECpm1 and ECpm2 in the Core programming module,
algorithms return several outputs based on additional parameters ranked in the wizard
panel of the Cpm, which will help to design customized business model scenarios according
to each stakeholder perspective. Each output is assigned to five main targets related with
several scopes: (i) Financial Appraisal, (ii) Renovation Strategy, (iii) Energy Community,
(iv) Welfare and Security, (v) Marketing. Hence, it must be noted that the outputs obtained
by running a typical simulation of the PEDRERA model return a wide number of KPIs and
other information deriving by the aggregation of data. The model calculates several KPIs for
different stakeholders in addition to intermediate results (the shared cost of the operation
to be added to the single building renovation costs). The main KPIs adopted in the financial
appraisal are: (1) the Monthly payments (the total value of monthly payments that each
type of user should pay. The amount should stay within the user’s ability to pay: namely,
EUR 120 is the upper monthly limit, or a maximum amount of EUR 6300 per dwelling is
considered); (2) End-user Savings (the percentage of investment an end-user can save if
they adhere to large-scale intervention, compared to the same type of retrofitting works
done on the single-building scale); (3) Public Sector Operational costs (the operational cost
assumed by the Public Sector); (4) the Revolving funds (the investment amount granted

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

to UT4—inscription—that will be recovered when the property is transferred to a new
user; (5) Private Parties Operational costs (the operational cost assumed, considering
both direct and indirect costs assuming overheads); (6) Gross Benefits and EBT (Earnings
Before Taxes), expressed as value and % of operational costs; (7) Financial costs (estimated
financial costs according to the loan rate and its duration); (8) Financial needs (the loan
capital necessary to cover operation costs); (9) Cash-flow (based on the economic model’s
calculation of the operation-related cash flow ROI).
Specific outputs are presented for each type of stakeholder, i.e., End-users, Public
Sector, and Private Parties (Table 1). One of the most relevant End-user key parameters in
the Financial Appraisal, displayed in the output dashboard is the average value of the final
investment according to the monthly/rate payments depending on the User Types (UT)
characterization. Indeed, each UT category means one to five typologies considering the
number of scheduled fees (pay), the loan duration between 5 and 10 years, or the level of
vulnerability:

•
•
•
•
•

UT 1 (2 pay).
UT 2 (60 pay/5 years).
UT 3 (120 pay/10 years).
UT 4* (2 pay/5 years). * Financing scheme for vulnerable people covered by Public Sector.
UT 5 (96 pay/8 years).

The first category UT1 means that type of user—e.g., companies or commercial—is
able to cover two payments at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation works. The
UT2 means that the investment is covered within the time frame of 5 years in 60 monthly
quotes to pay. The UT4 represents the financing scheme adopted for vulnerable persons
and that is entirely covered by Public Sector in the time frame of 5 years. The last two user
types, UT3 and UT5, refer to the payment of the whole financial operation for a longer time
frame (10 and 8, respectively) with, consequently, a higher number of monthly quotes and
an extra cost considered for the extended loan, but a reduced monthly payment.
3. Case Studies
The first important step in order to validate the PEDRERA model was to test the
methodology and the model prototype in existing energy-efficient retrofitting projects at
district level. Thus, the idea was to compare the results provided by the model with at least
one performed project where data related to the performance of the district before and after
retrofitting was available. Finally, two specific case studies were selected to test the model’s
performance under different conditions including climate aspects, boundary conditions,
uses, building typologies, intervention levels, conservation conditions, existence of specific
barriers, consideration of historical buildings, and other aspects.
Therefore, once the model had been designed, the PEDRERA tool was tested in two
case studies in Spain: one in St. Coloma de Gramenet, deputy of Barcelona; and the second
in the city of Palma de Mallorca. For this test, before the selection of the buildings, two
cadastral databases were completed.
In the first case study, St. Coloma de Gramenet, 16 buildings were selected from
a recently concluded real large-scale renovation plan (ACR 2, “Mas Marí”) [8,49,50] as
showed in Table 2 and Figure 3. In this case study, wider and more detailed information was
already available from a recently concluded intervention and has been adopted to validate
both the model and the operating of the whole tool as well. The available information
regarded the renovation costs and solutions from each building (e.g., the adopted measures
on façade and equipment) and also the cost of design, construction supervision, and
other operational costs (Opex) from public and private parties engaged in the process.
Furthermore, the UTs categories (i.e., UT1, UT2, UT3, and UT5) for the different households
and tenants were considered as well as the provision of revolving funds covered by the
PA (UT4).

of intervention (EUR/dwelling) was applied to each type of selected building [28,43,52].
In both methods, the potential energy benefits of each building were assessed according to the “energy renovation strategies” report of the Institut Català d’Energia (ICAEN) [37].
The report represents the consolidated reference adopted by the Spanish LTRS plan [53]
for the updated Long-Term Strategy for Energy Renovation in the Building Sector in Spain
(ERESEE 2020) [27], and by the Enerpat and Enerhat platforms [39,42]. Nevertheless, as
explained above, for the determination of the cost of intervention and energy savings

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

12 of 20

for each building, a quick survey of the consistency of the buildings was carried out to
subsequently establish a cost comparison with the advanced studies of ICAEN.
A first package of passive measures, “PQ1+” (“PQ1” meaning insulation of exterior
façade with EPS of 6 cm, insulation of interior roof with 8 cm of mineral wool and renovation
of windows with a PVC frame and low-emissivity glass, “+” meaning additional solar
shading systems), was adopted in both case studies. According to the above-mentioned
report from ICAEN, this package of energy efficiency measures achieves important savings,
up to 40% of final energy consumption in most types of housing. Specifically, the savings
are less than 40% only in some Spanish climatic zones of types C, D, E, and I. A second
comprehensive rehabilitation package of passive and active solutions, “PQ5+” (i.e., “PQ1+”
meaning insulation in the facade, insulation of roof, change of windows, solar shading,
“+” meaning renovation of the boiler and PV/solar panels for RES), was limited to just
three buildings in Palma de Mallorca where the extension of the envelope and therefore the
economic effort were minimal. In that case, the renovation package allows very significant
energy savings, between 32 and 57% final energy savings in mild climates (B3) and between
46 and 66% in cold climates (E1).
According to the different measures adopted in each building, the average costs of
intervention had been calculated (Table 4). The obtained average cost in the Palma case
study was EUR 17,335.58 for a single-family dwelling and EUR 13,858.99 for a multi-family
dwelling. In the Santa Coloma case, this value drops to EUR 7797.02 for a multi-family
dwelling. The discrepancy of these intervention costs (PEC) is mainly the result of the
differences in consistency (building typology, no. of floors, extension of the envelope and
state of conservation) of the buildings, rather than the package of measures adopted.

In order to endorse both the methodology and the test, these costs have been compared with the average costs per dwelling (both multi-family and single-family) from
four different sources: ITEC LCQA 2016 [24], ERESEE 2020 [27], PMRH 2021 [28], and
ICAEN 2016 [37]. This activity confirmed that the values adopted as model input in the
Palma de Mallorca case study are quite below the average value per dwelling obtained
from the different databases described above: i.e., EUR 25,936.10 for single-family homes
and EUR 11,165.46 for multi-family homes (Table 5). As a result, there is evidence of a
deviation span around −24% and +23% (with an average value of −8%) in the case of
Palma de Mallorca when compared to parametric costs from the literature in Spain [27,37].
This comparison was also implemented in the case study of Santa Coloma of Gramenet
where the final real costs provided by the Local Administration had been assumed in
the model. In that case, the results confirmed a higher deviation span around +2% and
+124% between real intervention and parametric costs [27,37] with an average span of +52%.
Therefore, a quick smart survey of the state of the buildings and/or an existing database
is very relevant for the evaluation of building consistency while calculating the economic
effort of each measure to be adopted in a large-scale action. Indeed, the initial knowledge
about consistency is essential for making the process smarter and more predictable.

All the proposed packages of measures have been designed to achieve a reduction
in energy demand above 35%. This reduction means a grant percentage of 35% based
on the national grants that can be obtained for retrofitting in Spain [33]. Otherwise, for
the definition of the different scenarios, higher costs of intervention can be accepted, thus
achieving a reduction in energy demand around 45–50% or higher, which would allow
access to a subsidy between 40 and 65%, or 80%.
4. Results
The main insights of the PEDRERA project can be considered to be the broader
“envisioning” of the project and the design of a tool able to support the renovation process
thanks to: (a) the gathering and aggregation of information and data according to the four
domains in separate databases as described above; (b) the management of a large number
of buildings that can be directly selected on a GIS-based map, in order boost large-scale
actions; (c) the design of the scenarios in a Python programming environment inspiring a
multidisciplinary approach and stakeholders’ perspectives; (d) the prediction of multiple
scenarios as a result of the designed tool and algorithms able to consider a large amount of
data; and (e) the visualization of the planned economic scenario in a QGIS environment as
briefly shown in Figures 5–7.
The results of the economic model demonstrate that the model is robust and flexible
enough to allow different breakdowns between user types, variations in operational costs, variations in financial costs (i.e., interest rates), investment per dwelling (7000–14,000 EUR/dwelling)
for single and multi-family homes, and number of entities that are involved (over 150). Its
robustness refers mainly to the feasibility of the final monthly end-user payments (UTs 2,3
and 5) remaining below EUR 120 or rising to undergo a large-scale retrofitting operation
(Tables 6 and 7). Its flexibility mainly refers to the capacity to adapt the business model
not only to the different schemes available or to the target feasibility, but also to provide:
multiple technical solutions; multiple deductions/subsidies based on the planned level
of energy efficiency; different durations of loans; and other benefits and savings for all
stakeholders (shared costs, reduction of operating costs, increasing property value as a
result of economies of scale).

In addition, the test demonstrated that while adopting both methods (direct/indirect),
the costs of intervention were partially satisfactorily coherent among them. In some cases,
a range deviation greater than 15% was observed due to the varied and spontaneous
building typologies (mainly single-family buildings) in this area, and their age (62% were
originally built before 1940). For this reason, the second method with direct cost analysis
was adopted when deviation was higher than 15 % compared to the indirect method
(parametric) based on the literature applied to the cluster of buildings. As result of the test
phase, the PEDRERA tool has been shown to be very flexible when modifying the input
data, such as the number of entities that are used for dwellings or other uses, percentage of
grants, service costs (e.g., operational, financial costs) for the agent involved, public–private
participation fees in the different phases of the renovation process, percentage of users
of different types (UTs), duration and cost of loans, and the distribution of shared costs
and quotes within each building. Furthermore, the model is designed to define the type
of loan (duration, number, and amount of rates) based on each main type of user (UTs),
and thus is able to foresee and to mitigate situations of economic vulnerability or other
arrears situations.
On the other hand, static data from external sources are stored in a database provided
by CICLICA [32]. As a result of the PEDRERA tool, having access to databases such as
the cadaster permits a very fast analysis and a formidable collection of information for the
agents interested in the business model. Once data are gathered in the PEDRERA model
from selection on the GIS Map, then they are combined with editable ones from users in
both the Core and Extra Core wizards. However, the interoperability of the tool does not
make it exempt from a direct analysis of the building and social consistency, or from the
verification of the data contained in the cadaster that, in some cases, have been proven to be
incorrect or out of date. For example, if a building did not exist anymore due to previously
unreported or outdated demolition, or maybe recent renovations had been carried out but
not registered in the cadaster, it was excluded from the analysis.
When all the inputs are correctly collected, then agents can design different scenarios
by customizing several business models. The scenarios are displayed directly in the
PEDRERA app, as well as output files in .csv format that successively will be exported
to PostGIS. Before exporting and visualizing the selected scenario in GIS, up to three
comparable scenarios can be displayed in the user-friendly frontend of the PEDRERA
app. Therefore, the model provides a comparison of the different results as a multi-radial
diagram visualization that covers each KPI resulting from the model and that is organized
for each stakeholder in both the analytics and the diagram. In this way, the user of the tool
can select a scenario that better fulfills their expectations and objectives.
5. Discussion
One of the main challenges faced by the PEDRERA project was to tackle the lack of
a coherent and coordinated business plan from design to implementation, and to deal
with the absence of feasibility and prediction which discourages people and limits the
potential savings and co-benefits achievable by large-scale actions. The use of the model
methodology and PEDRERA tool is helpful to reduce the burden of renovation programs
that are crucial to deliver these goals at the right scale required.
The financial appraisal module is part of a larger vision of the PEDRERA model [32]
that also considers other relevant aspects of the PED approach, i.e., energy production,
CO2 reduction, and impact on citizens’ security and welfare, among others. A wide
list of input and related KPIs are partly included within the algorithms of the financial
appraisal (Figure 2) and are part of the “inter ecosystem compatibility” concept of the
PEDRERA model. Indeed, thanks to the interoperability of the designed tool with GIS
and the whole Python programming environment, these aspects can be easily considered
in the multidimensional analysis while designing the renovation process. In addition,
the PEDRERA model is open and flexible enough to implement the financial appraisal
module in other ongoing available tools [44,54,55], which adopt a similar interoperable

Sustainability 2022, 14, 9672

17 of 20

methodology to PEDRERA and are also focused on energy production, balance, and
flexibility in Renewable Energy Community (REC) and PED design. This strength allows
to assess the wider and complex feasibility of the process.
The economic evaluation is likely the most important achievement considered in
the PEDRERA model [8,22,32], and the algorithms leading to the financial appraisal are
based on numerous considerations and experiences that have been previously tested and
implemented in several cities/regions across Europe [56]. Moving from these experiences
and successful business models, one of the most proven and attractive outputs for nearly all
household types is the impact of soft loans. Indeed, soft loans lend money to homeowners
at a lower interest rate than standard market conditions, enabling homeowners to borrow
money to carry out renovation work that increases the energy efficiency of their homes.
Furthermore, as a key input of the financial plan, the loan costs affect the marketing
effectiveness as well the calculation of the Return of Investment (ROI). Therefore, soft loans
are part of the third-party investment plans and include other advantages, such as a longer
term to maturity, and lower administrative and insurance costs. The overall budget and
the financial conditions are meant as key aspects able to ensure the viability and success of
the global operation. It should be ensured and demonstrated to the neighborhoods that the
overall budget is quite reduced compared to the market condition. Easy-to-use financial
mechanisms should manage the budget, ensuring minimal to no initial spills and, typically,
long payment periods. Indeed, the payment period adheres to a time frame acceptable to
both end-users and financial institutions (typically 5 to 10 years). These aspects have been
widely examined for all involved stakeholders, and two main factors are considered as
fundamental factors for success in the smart management of the specifically customizable
PPP model: provisions for grants and subsidies. Because homeowners and market actors
perceive city and regional governments to be trustworthy and legitimate coordinators
of housing retrofit programs, the business model is designed to enable cooperation with
local financing institutions, investors, and technical project managers. In addition, the
Public Sector is expected to assume a portion of operational works and uses subsidies to
compensate User Type 4 with an equivalent payment (mode inscription). Moreover, the
model is able to account for a tailored rate of default payments. Therefore, the remaining
users will pay an incrementally higher amount to cover the cost of defaulters even if they
will be urged to pay their debt.
On the other hand, the information gathered in the PEDRERA model and the data
preparation (detection of missing and anomalous data), significantly affects the accuracy of
the obtained result. For these reasons, the PEDRERA database is based on a preliminary
extensive cadastral survey provided by CICLICA as partner of the PEDRERA project.
Nevertheless, the lack of a more detailed preliminary analysis on consistency could affect
the whole business model that is not limited to the prediction of energy production or
energy demand reduction. Advanced projects such as RENOVEU [44], RETABIT [54],
and other online platforms such as GENCAT [43,57] support the provision of deeper
information at the building scale on building consistency, property, and environmental
impact from the very beginning. Hence, further collaboration and the implementation of
the PEDRERA model with new capabilities are expected.
6. Conclusions
The European Union’s target of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reaching climate neutrality by 2050 requires innovative solutions and services to boost the annual
renovation rate and to ensure that renovations reach the expected low/positive energy renovation standards. Energy rehabilitation actions constitutes a fundamental component of
meeting environmental objectives and the fight against climate change, defined by current
legislation and international commitments. Along with the macroeconomic impacts, PEDs
will contribute directly to the prosperity of consumers and families, to the improvement in
the environment of residential neighborhoods and to the quality of life in cities. On the
other hand, the transition to renewable energy sources will also generate new opportu-

nities in the labor market, increasing human capital and job creation, which also benefits
economic growth. Finally, investing in an entire district would benefit all residential and
also tertiary (shopping centers, sports centers, etc.) or educational buildings. Indeed, the
intervention at district level generates high returns for energy savings or production, as
well allows the acquisition of returns on investments in residential buildings that would
not be financially attractive if they were renovated independently.
In conclusion, the test phase of the PEDRERA tool led to the following considerations
on its potential and impact:

The data-driven solutions adopted allow a rapid analysis and a formidable data
collection. Nevertheless, this solution is not exempt from a preliminary direct analysis
of the building and social consistency. For example, in buildings where there is a lack
of internal horizontal division according to the condominium regulation, the building
is stacked as if it were a single-family building. However, there may be separate
apartments, commercial spaces, or other functions inside. For this reason, a granular
validation of the building consistency is always necessary.
The direct calculation of the renovation cost obtained by an analysis of the building
consistency and by the application of the construction costs coming from BEDEC
and other official databases determines a very acceptable deviation equal to 1% (in
the case of Palma) and 13% (in the case of St. Coloma) with respect to the values
tabulated by the literature (i.e., ERESEE 2020). Furthermore, the deviation of the
cost (PEC) in the case of St Coloma is due to the reduction of the intervention costs
because of the economic context of the district. Although this reduced span may be
acceptable in large-scale interventions (for example in the compilation of a SECAP
or earlier business opportunities for investors), a customized plan for each end-user
must consider a detailed assessment case-by-case.
The possibility offered by the model to intervene in advance on each main input of a
business model, (e.g., by modifying the type/duration of loan based on the amount of
the intervention) makes it possible to reduce the monthly fee as far as possible and to
meet situations in which a user is economically vulnerable.
