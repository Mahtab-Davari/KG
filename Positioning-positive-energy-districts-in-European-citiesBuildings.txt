Abstract: There are many concepts for buildings with integrated renewable energy systems that
have received increased attention during the last few years. However, these concepts only strive
to streamline building-level renewable energy solutions. In order to improve the flexibility of
decentralized energy generation, individual buildings and energy systems should be able to interact
with each other. The positive energy district (PED) concept highlights the importance of active
interaction between energy generation systems, energy consumers and energy storage within a
district. This paper strives to inform the public, decision makers and fellow researchers about the
aspects that should be accounted for when planning and implementing different types of PEDs
in different regions throughout the European Union. The renewable energy environment varies
between different EU regions, in terms of the available renewable energy sources, energy storage
potential, population, energy consumption behaviour, costs and regulations, which affect the design
and operation of PEDs, and hence, no PED is like the other. This paper provides clear definitions
for different types of PEDs, a survey of the renewable energy market circumstances in the EU and a
detailed analysis of factors that play an essential role in the PED planning process.

1. Introduction
Various zero energy building (ZEB) concepts have been applied and used in the
building sector all over the world. The overall ZEB definition states that “the building
can be considered as ZEB after it shows through actual measurements that the energy
delivered to the building is less than or equal to the onsite renewable exported energy” [1].
These concepts are, however, only applicable on individual buildings or groups of buildings
and consider neither the impact on society at large nor the interaction with other energy
consumers and producers. Most ZEBs even neglect the fact that the mobility sector is
gradually connecting to the electricity grid. Nevertheless, ZEBs have recently received
immense academic and political interest around the world [2–7].
The USA established the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 [8] to support
the building sector to create zero energy commercial buildings by the year 2030. It also
mentions converting 50% of American commercial buildings to ZEBs by 2040 and converting all commercial buildings into ZEBs by 2050 [9]. Similar legislation and regulations
have been adopted by the EU in the form of Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings
(EPBD), which aims to make all public buildings and new buildings nearly zero energy
buildings by 2020 [7].
In Europe, the European Union (EU) has developed a framework that aims to reduce
the emissions from buildings by improving the energy efficiency at the building level.
The Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD) initiated in May 2010 states that
a nearly ZEB is a building with a high efficiency in terms of energy utilization and an energy
demand that is mostly covered by on-site renewable energy generation [7]. The EPBD also
mentions that the nearly ZEB definition can be flexible and adjusted to national or local

requirements and targets. Nearly ZEB impact factors, such as the energy efficiency of the
buildings and renewable energy sources, are also defined on a national or a regional level.
Moreover, the primary energy factor is defined by the EU states based on national policies.
Cost-optimal buildings are also introduced in the EPBD in the Delegated Regulation
No 244/2012 [10]. The cost-optimality is defined as the optimal ratio between the life cycle
costs and the energy efficiency of the building [11]. This ratio varies from one EU region
to another because the climate and the building standards are different in different EU
regions [12–14].
According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), a ZEB is an “energy efficient
building where, on a source energy basis, the actual annual delivered energy is less than
or equal to the on-site renewable exported energy” [6]. Here, the source energy means
the total life cycle energy of the building, including the building energy; the energy used
for the extraction, transportation and processing of primary fuels; energy losses in the
thermal and electrical plant; and energy losses in transport and energy distribution to the
building site. Building energy refers to the on-site building energy consumption, including
heating, cooling, ventilation, domestic hot water, indoor and outdoor use, lights, plug loads,
process energy, elevators, conveying systems and intra-building transportation.
In addition to the ZEB concept, the DOE has defined three other concepts, the zero
energy community (ZECo), zero energy campus (ZEC) and zero energy portfolio (ZEP),
which consider a cluster of buildings that operates as a unit that shares the same renewable
energy systems [6]. These concepts are, however, not clearly defined, and the differences
between the concepts are quite indistinct. The main advantage of the ZEB, ZECo, ZEC and
ZEP concepts is that they strive to cover the aggregated demand of the buildings, and thus,
the generated renewable energy is used where it is needed the most.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has proposed a concept called autonomous
ZEB, which is an extension of the ZEB [15]. These buildings are self-sustaining buildings
with no connection to the grid and are able to produce enough on-site energy to satisfy
their own energy demand. In order to satisfy the energy demand day and night, summer
and winter, energy must be stored. This differs from the net ZEB concept, as the net ZEBs
are able to interact with the external grid as long as the annual energy export is equal
to the annual energy import. The IEA does also bring up energy plus buildings (+ZEB),
which export more energy than they import [15].
Table 1 shows a summary of the zero energy and positive energy definitions found in
the literature. Here, it can be observed that most of the definitions address building-level
applications and that only one definition addresses building energy efficiency, renewable
energy, energy storage and as energy trading.

Most of the definitions found in the literature are different versions of the ZEB concept,
and only a few definitions treat zero energy and energy positivity on a district or neighbourhood level. Especially, energy positivity on a district scale, so-called positive energy
districts (PEDs), seems to be in an early conceptual phase. PEDs are gaining interest in the
EU, as the European Clean Energy package is opening up a new opportunity for so-called
energy communities, consisting of multiple small-scale energy consumers and providers,
to share energy in local energy networks [22]. PEDs are hence becoming an increasingly
interesting and a more competitive alternative to ZEBs, as they are able to exploit more of
the available energy generation and energy storage potential of the community, i.e., the district. In PEDs, the renewable energy supply and demand can be unevenly distributed
throughout the district, which allows a more strategical installation of renewable energy
systems and energy storage.
As PEDs are starting to gain interest in various research projects, clear standardized
definitions and frameworks need to be established. The objective of this paper is to provide
clear definitions for different types of PEDs, a survey of the renewable energy market
circumstances in the EU and a detailed analysis of factors that play an essential role in the
PED planning process. The analysis discusses the available alternatives for constructing
PEDs and networks of PEDs in European cities as well as the regulative aspects that are
relevant for the implementation of PEDs in the EU. This analysis is also the novelty of the
paper, as no other study of PEDs in the literature treats the preconditions and available
options for PEDs on a general level.
2. Methods
The study was carried out in three steps. The first step was to produce a description of
the PED concept and to develop a clear set of criteria that every PED must satisfy. This step
was conducted by gathering information about the PED definition from the limited amount
of literature about PEDs that is available.
The second step was to investigate the renewable energy environment in the EU.
This step was carried out by collecting data and information about:

•
•
•
•

The renewable energy generation and energy storage potential in different EU regions;
The techno-economic properties of different renewable energy and energy storage technologies;
The energy consumption and energy consumption trends in different EU regions;
The electricity prices in different EU regions and factors affecting the electricity price.

In order to keep the collected data at a manageable size, the authors mainly collected data for four EU countries (Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy) and their
corresponding capital cities.
The first two steps of the study served as a base for the PED implementation analysis,
which was conducted in the third and final step. The aim of the PED implementation
analysis was to form a conception about the possibilities of implementing PEDs in the EU.
The authors also used references from the scientific literature to gather ideas of how to
implement different technologies. Additionally, the authors suggest a new idea of how
networks of PEDs could be constructed and how PEDs could interact with each other.
Finally, the analysis assesses how the current EU regulations and guidelines could affect
the implementation of PEDs in the EU.

4.1. Renewable Energy Sources and Their Availability in the EU
During the last 15 years, the amount of new investments in renewable energy has
increased dramatically, especially for solar and wind energy technologies. The compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) for the 2004–2018 period for solar and wind were 20% and
15%, respectively [29]. This investment boom in solar and wind energy has contributed
to technological improvements and larger markets, and consequently cost reductions for
technology [30]. The evolution of the renewable energy market has engendered better
preconditions for PEDs and other energy transition projects. Table A1 in the Appendix A
presents the average costs and capacity factors of different renewable energy technologies
that can be utilized in PEDs.
Most renewable energy sources are somehow dependent on the geographical location
of the site. Solar and wind energy are dependent on the climatic conditions of the site,
while hydro power is dependent on the climatic as well as topographical and geological
conditions of the site. Bioenergy, i.e., power generated by biomass, on the other hand, is not
as dependent on the geographical conditions as the above-mentioned technologies.
The geographical differences in renewable energy environments are evident when
the renewable energy mixes for different EU countries is studied. The renewable energy
mixes of Finland, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany are presented in Table 2. It can be
observed that there are some considerable differences in the renewable energy generation
between these countries, which are partly caused by geographical factors. Figure 6 shows

4.1.1. Solar
The cost of solar electricity has decreased dramatically during the last decade. Particularly, the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations has decreased significantly during
the last few years. According to IRENA, the global weighted average total installed cost
of utility-scale solar PV projects dropped from 4621 USD/kW in 2010 to 1210 USD/kW in
2018 [32]. The weighted average capacity factor for solar PV increased from 14% to 18%
during the same time interval [32].
The installation cost of concentrating solar power (CSP) also fell from around 8829
USD/kW in 2010 to 5204 USD/kW in 2018, although the year-on-year variability has been
relatively high due to the small scale of the market [32]. In 2010, the levelized cost of elec-

4.1.1. Solar
The cost of solar electricity has decreased dramatically during the last decade. Particularly, the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations has decreased significantly during
the last few years. According to IRENA, the global weighted average total installed cost of
utility-scale solar PV projects dropped from 4621 USD/kW in 2010 to 1210 USD/kW in
2018 [32]. The weighted average capacity factor for solar PV increased from 14% to 18%
during the same time interval [32].
The installation cost of concentrating solar power (CSP) also fell from around 8829
USD/kW in 2010 to 5204 USD/kW in 2018, although the year-on-year variability has been
relatively high due to the small scale of the market [32]. In 2010, the levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE) for CSP was 0.19 USD/kWh, which is nearly twice as high as the LCOE
for solar PV in the same year [32]. Hence, solar PV is still more profitable than CSP for
electricity generating purposes. However, according to a cost reduction potential analysis
by IRENA 2016, the gap between the LCOEs for CSP and solar PV will be reduced to
0.02 USD/kWh by 2025 [30].
Apart from electricity generated by PV and CSP, solar radiation can also be used for
generating heat using so-called solar thermal collectors. These solar thermal collectors
generate thermal energy in the form of hot water, which is usually used directly as domestic
hot water [33]. The two most popular solar thermal collector technologies are flat plate
collectors and evacuated tube collectors. Evacuated tube collectors cost 20% to 50% more
than flat plate collectors, but they are more efficient and easier to apply in cold climates
and regions without a substantial amount of sunlight. Due to the excellent performance of
evacuated tube collectors in cold climates, it is also possible to use them as a heat source
for building heating systems.
Despite the great potential of solar thermal collectors, the growth rate of solar heat
in Europe has, according to Madsen and Hansen (2019), decreased during the last five
years [34]. Only a few large projects have been executed in EU countries such as Poland
and Denmark during the last few years [35].
The electrical power generated by solar PV and CSP as well as the heat produced
by solar thermal collectors is dependent on solar irradiation [36,37]. Since the EU region
covers over 30 degrees of latitude, there are considerable differences in solar radiation
between some EU regions. Figure 7 presents the monthly global irradiation data for the
four European example cities. The data were collected from the Photovoltaic Geographic
Information System (PVGIS), which is a geographical information system developed by
the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission [38,39].

technology. These technology improvements, however, mainly benefit wind power installations in regions with low annual wind speeds [44]. In regions with high wind speeds, the
benefits of the increased power generation are smaller than the cost difference between the
old and new turbine technology. Hence, the benefits of the technological improvements
of wind turbines are primarily observed for less windy sites. The improvements in wind
power resulted in an increase in rotor diameter and turbine size between 2010 and 2017.
In France, the rotor diameter of newly commissioned projects increased by 25% between
2010 and 2017 [32].
The wind power potential of a region is primarily determined by two physical qualities:
wind speed and air density. These qualities are, however, dependent on the meteorological

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

11 of 30

conditions, topography and surface roughness of the site [45]. Due to the sensitivity to
different variables, it is challenging to accurately estimate the exploitable wind energy [45].
Estimating local extreme wind speeds and turbulence is also considered a challenge;
these have an impact on the wind power potential.
When the wind speed and air density are known, the exploitable wind power can be
calculated as follows:
1
P = ρAv3 .
(1)
2
where ρ is the air density, A is the cross-sectional area of the wind turbine and v is the wind
speed [46]. Since the generated power is expressed as a cubic function of the wind speed,
even a small variation in wind speed entails a significant difference in generated electrical
power. The average wind speeds of the four European cities are presented in Table 3.

4.1.3. Hydro
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, about half of the European
hydropower potential is already utilized [48]. There are two types of hydro power—
run-of-river (ROR) hydropower and reservoir hydropower—both of which are highly
dependent on the geography of the region [49]. ROR hydropower uses the natural flow
of rivers to generate electricity through a turbine and is thus dependent on seasonal
variations in precipitation in the upstream catchment area [48,49]. Reservoir hydropower
can store large volumes of water and is therefore less dependent on a continuous water flow.
Reservoir hydropower is, however, highly dependent on the topography of the site [49].
The EU countries with the highest amounts of hydropower generation per capita are listed
in Table 4.

4.1.4. Biomass
Biomass is a controversial renewable energy source, which is sometimes not considered to be as “green” as the above-mentioned renewable energy technologies. Unlike other
renewable energy technologies, bioenergy produces emissions that might be problematic
in densely populated areas. Biomass is, however, by far, the most flexible of these renewable energy sources since it is possible to both transport and store biomass in large

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

12 of 30

volumes. Biomass is therefore a great alternative to fossil fuels in energy system balancing
applications [50].
Today, 75% of the energy generated by biomass is used for heating and cooling
purposes, 13% for electricity generation and 12% for transport [50]. In 2017, biomass represented 60% of the total production of primary renewable energy [51].
Biomass is often used as a fuel in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. These plants
often consist of a biomass-fired boiler where heat is transferred to a steam cycle [52].
The steam runs true turbines to generate electricity and through heat exchangers to acquire
heat. Biomass contains significantly more moisture than fossil fuel. Hence, there is a
significant amount of latent heat that can be recovered from the exhaust gases of a biomassbased CHP plant. This means that the exhaust gas heat recovery has a crucial impact on
the overall efficiency of the plant. For wood-chip-fired CHP plants, the latent heat recovery
is the highest when the exhaust gas temperature is 30–65 ◦ C [53].
Biomass is competing with natural gas, which is considered as a relatively clean fossil
fuel. The investment cost for biomass power plants is, in general, more expensive than
that for natural gas power plants, although the fuel costs are on the same level. Unrefined
biomass contains high levels of potassium and other alkalis, which cause deposit formation
and corrosion in the boilers of combustion power plants [54,55]. This costly problem
can be minimized by pretreating the biomass and/or by adding sulfur in the combustion
process [55,56]. These countermeasures are also reflected in the cost of bioenergy technology.
Another challenge with biomass is the limited availability of reliable, affordable and
sustainable biomass [50].
Bioenergy generation is not as dependent on the geographical location of the generation site as the earlier-mentioned renewable energy sources, since biomass can be
transported and utilized far away from the extraction site. Most of the bio-based energy
generation within the EU is descended from forestry. Transporting wood-based biomass is
expensive due to its low energy density compared to fossil fuels (the lower heating value
(LHV) of wood pellets is 17.5 MJ/kg, which is less than half of the LHV of most fossil
fuels) [50,57,58]. According to IEA-ETSAP and IRENA 2015, the cost of locally collected
biomass ranges from USD 4 to 8 per GJ, while the cost of globally traded biomass ranges
from USD 8 to 12 per GJ [52]. Biomass energy generation is therefore more lucrative in
countries with domestic forest resources. The biggest bioenergy consumers per capita in
Europe are the Nordic and Baltic countries as well as Austria [50]. These are all countries
with great forest resources. Other EU countries with a forest land cover over 40% are
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia and Slovakia.
4.1.5. Geothermal
Geothermal power plants use thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth to
generate power through steam turbines [59]. These plants usually require deep wells to
reach sufficient temperatures (often higher than 180 ◦ C). A large share of the installation
costs are comprised of costs related to the construction of the wells. The weighted average
total installation cost of geothermal power plants is 3976 USD/kW, which is quite high
compared to other renewable energy technologies [32]. Although the installation costs
of geothermal power plants are usually high, the operating costs are relatively low and
predictable [32,59].
In theory, geothermal energy can be accessed everywhere as long as there are not any
restrictions on the deepness of boreholes. In reality, it is not economically and technically
possible to drill deep enough to harness geothermal energy. The vast majority of geothermal
energy systems that are suitable for power generation are located in areas with volcanic
activity, usually close to tectonic plate boundaries [59]. In Europe, these areas are mainly
found in southern Italy and Iceland.

4.2. Energy Storage Systems and Their Application in the EU
Energy storage can provide sufficient flexibility to the energy system by evening out
peaks in energy generation and demand. Hence, the importance of energy storage methods
is growing as the amount of intermittent renewable energy is increasing.
The potential of some energy storage methods is highly dependent on the geographical
characteristics of the site. Especially, large-scale energy storage methods such as pumped
hydro and compressed air energy storage (CAES) are only suitable for some geographical
regions, partly because of their low energy density and partly because of their dependency on suitable geographical features, such as geology, topography and precipitation.
Even small-scale energy storage methods, such as different kinds of batteries, are somewhat
dependent on the environment.
4.2.1. Pumped Hydro
Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is the most widely deployed technology for large-scale
energy storage worldwide [60]. According to the International Hydropower Association,
PHS accounts for 94% of the global installed energy storage capacity [61]. PHS systems
store energy by pumping water from a reservoir to another reservoir at a higher altitude.
The potential power of the water in the higher water storage reservoir is then extracted by
releasing the water through a turbine to the lower reservoir [60].
The main advantages of PHS systems are their low installation cost per storage
capacity and long life spans. The PHS potential and investment cost are heavily dependent
on the geographical properties of the site. The performance of a PHS system depends on
the water volume involved as well as the height difference between the higher and lower
water storage reservoirs [62]. These characteristics are defined by the availability of water
as well as the topography and geology of the site [62]. Due to the very site-specific nature
of PHS systems, the installation cost varies between 5 and 100 USD/kWh [60].
The geographical limitations of PHS systems can definitely be considered as a major
drawback for the storage method [61]. Another downside with PHS technology is its
relatively slow reaction time compared to batteries [61]. This prevents PHS systems from
being used as short-erm storage for balancing frequent variations in energy demand and
supply.
A study by Gimeno-Gutiérrez and Lacal-Arántegui (2014) presents estimates of the
pumped hydro storage potential in different European countries, based on a geographical
information system (GIS) developed by a team from the Joint Research Centre and University College Cork [63]. The study used the GIS to identify potential pumped hydro storage
sites where two existing reservoirs at different altitudes can be connected. The report
presents both an unconstrained theoretical potential and a constrained realizable potential.
Table 5 presents a part of the results that were obtained from the study.

The theoretical potential includes the following constraints: a minimum head of 150 m, a minimum reservoir capacity of 100,000 m3 ,
a minimum distance of 500 m to inhabited sites, a minimum distance of 200 m to existing transportation infrastructure, a maximum distance
of 20 km to electricity transmission, and location outside Natura 2000 conservation areas and UNESCO sites.

According to the results of the study by Gimeno-Gutiérrez and Lacal-Arántegui (2014),
countries with mountain ranges, such as Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, the UK

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

and Norway, have the highest potential for pumped hydro storage [63]. Naturally flowing
water and evaporation are, however, not taken into account in the report by the JRC,
which will affect the PHS potential.
4.2.2. Compressed Air Storage
The operating principle of compressed air is to use electrical power to compress air
and thereby store potential energy in the form of compressed air in an airtight storage
cavern or vessel. The potential energy is released by letting the compressed air run through
a turbine that generates electricity. Compressed air storage is an energy storage method
that is particularly suitable in areas with already-available storage caverns, such as empty
salt caverns and depleted oil and gas fields. Storing the compressed air in storage vessels
is also possible, although it is significantly more expensive and not competitive with other
energy storage methods [60].
This method does have a few major drawbacks. One problem is the low energy density
of the storage method, and another problem is the low roundtrip efficiency. The low
roundtrip efficiency is mainly caused by the compression process, which generates a
significant amount of waste heat, and the air expansion process, which needs external
heating to improve the power quality of the turbine [60].
Salt caverns and depleted oil and natural gas fields are by far the cheapest storage
space for compressed air storage, but suitable storage caverns are unevenly distributed
around Europe [60,64]. In Europe, eligible onshore salt caverns are located in northern
and central Germany, Poland, parts of the UK, Denmark, eastern and northern parts of the
Netherlands, northeast Spain, eastern France, western Portugal, central Romania, northeast
Ukraine, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, western Greece and central Albania [64].
4.2.3. Batteries
Batteries are excellent for short-term residential energy storage, due to their short
reaction time and high discharge rate. The residential energy storage systems market has
also surged as a result of enhancements in residential solar PV regulations, subsidies and
tax incentives as well as rapid price reductions for battery technologies [65]. Residential
energy storage system shipments are, hence, expected to grow with a CAGR of 30% during
the coming years [65].
Li-ion batteries are expected to lead the residential energy storage market in the
future, due to their high efficiency and the declining cost of lithium [65,66]. In 2018,
Li-ion batteries accounted for 49.3% of the residential energy storage market, followed by
lead-acid batteries, with 40.7%.
The Li-ion battery market has grown rapidly during recent years as a consequence
of the increase in electrical vehicle manufacturing [67]. There has also been a significant increase in the market for Li-ion batteries in residential energy storage applications.
The market of residential Li-ion batteries is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of
33.2% [65]. Large-scale production facilities and significant investments in R&D also drove
the Li-ion battery price down from 1000 USD/kWh in 2010 to 254 USD/kWh in 2017.
The price is expected to reach 100 USD/kWh by 2025, if not sooner [65].
Lead-acid batteries are also popular on the residential energy storage market. These batteries are cheaper than Li-ion batteries, but their performance is not as good [65]. The market for lead-acid batteries in residential energy storage applications is also expected to
grow significantly in the near future [65].
Both Li-ion and lead-acid batteries degrade over time. The degradation is additionally accelerated by chemical side reactions caused by the environmental and functional
conditions [68]. The more the battery is charged and discharged, the shorter the lifespan is.
Today, the average lifespan of Li-ion and lead-acid batteries is 5–20 years [60].
As mentioned earlier, batteries are electrochemical devices that degrade over time,
partly because of the functional conditions. High and low temperatures are driving factors
that accelerate the degradation of Li-ion batteries [68,69]. Li-ion battery operation is

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

15 of 30

also negatively affected by low temperatures. Battery capacity is significantly lower for
sub-zero operating temperatures [69]. In cold conditions, it is possible to partly heat the
batteries with internally generated heat, but at temperatures as cold as −20 ◦ C, internally
generated heat is not enough to maintain the operating temperature at a sufficient level [70].
Temperature-related problems can, however, be overcome by installing auxiliary cooling
and heating units.
4.2.4. Thermal Energy Storage
Thermal energy can be stored in three forms: latent energy, chemical energy and
sensible energy [71,72]. Latent thermal energy storage (TES) uses phase change materials to
store thermal energy, while chemical TES stores thermal energy through chemical reactions.
Sensible TES stores thermal energy by varying the temperature of the storage medium.
Of these three TES methods, sensible TES is the most developed and cost-effective method.
Sensible TES can be used in both short-term and long-term storage applications. Longterm or seasonal sensible TES systems are typically placed underground and use liquids,
usually water, and solids, e.g., soil or rock, as storage media. The most common seasonal
sensible TES systems are hot water tank storage, water–gravel pit storage and borehole
TES.
Seasonal sensible TES combined with solar heat collectors has become a popular
method for storing “green” heat. This technology is widely used in Germany, especially on
a district level, to provide heat for space heating and domestic hot water preparation [73].
In Germany, central solar heating plants with integrated seasonal sensible TES can reduce
the district heating fossil fuel demand by more than 50%.
The main concern with seasonal sensible TES today is heat losses [71]. The heat
losses are determined by the temperature gradient, storage volume and storage medium.
Low heat losses are, hence, accomplished by minimizing the temperature difference between the storage medium and the surroundings, maximizing the storage volume and
using a storage medium with a high specific heat capacity. Short-term TES systems are
usually not affected by heat losses and can therefore operate at high temperatures and
with relatively low storage volumes. Seasonal TES systems, on the other hand, are more
exposed to heat losses and therefore usually operate at low temperatures. These types of
TES systems need auxiliary heating systems such as preheaters or heat pumps to increase
the temperature of the stored thermal energy before so that it can be used for space heating
and domestic hot water [71].
According to cost data for sensible TES systems in Germany, there is a strong decrease
in investment costs per storage capacity with increasing storage volume [73]. Despite the
strong volume dependency, sensible TES installation costs are relatively low compared to
electricity storage. The cost range for sensible TES storage is 0.1–10 USD/kWh [72].
Thermal Energy Storage Potential in Different EU Regions
Sensible TES systems, especially for seasonal storage applications, are negatively
affected by low ambient temperatures. Low ambient temperatures entail greater heat losses
from the TES to the surroundings. Particularly, regions with sub-zero-degree temperatures
might cause problems for sensible TES systems that use water as the storage medium [71].
Borehole TES systems are extremely sensitive to the underground conditions of the
site. The thermal conductivity and the heat capacity of the soil as well as the ground water
level and flow affect the performance of borehole TES systems, and the stress distribution
within a geologic medium might also affect the drilling [71,74,75]. These soil and ground
water properties are highly dependent on the geographical location of the storage site.
4.3. Energy Demand in Different EU Regions
The energy demand of household consumers in Europe is highly dependent on
climatic conditions [76]. An analysis by Tzeiranaki et al. (2019) shows a strong positive
correlation between heating degree days and household energy consumption [76]. It is,

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

16 of 30

however, hard to show the direct impact of climatic conditions on total household energy
consumption, as the energy consumption is also affected by other regional factors, e.g.,
building regulations, consumer behaviour, economic conditions and population density.
The U-value requirement, i.e., the highest allowable coefficient of heat transfer to the
surroundings, is an essential part of the building regulations that affect the heating demand
of buildings in a particular region. The U-value requirements define the maximum allowed
heat loss rate of a building. Table 6 shows the U-value regulations of Helsinki, Amsterdam,
Rome and Berlin.

Energy consumption behaviour is also an essential factor that affects the energy
demand of a region. Consumption behaviour can be divided into several categories
or sectors, such as household, transport, industry and commercial and public services.
The total household energy consumption of Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy
is depicted in Figure 8. It can be observed that Finland, which is the northernmost of the

is, however, not the only factor that affects energy consumption. The fact that energy
consumption in the Netherlands is lower than in Italy supports this statement.

as natural gas represents 14% of the German energy mix, while only 6% of the Finnish

Finland, as natural gas represents 14% of the German energy mix, while only 6% of the
Finnish energy generation mix is covered by natural gas [31]. As the share of renewable
energy grows throughout the EU, the renewable environment becomes an increasingly
important electricity price supply side factor. Parts of the European energy market have

energy generation mix is covered by natural gas [31]. As the share of renewable energy
grows throughout the EU, the renewable environment becomes an increasingly important
electricity price supply side factor. Parts of the European energy market have always been
highly dependent on annual precipitation, which affects the supply of hydropower [82].
Now, variations in solar radiation and wind speed are also starting to show in the electricity
spot prices. In the third quarter of 2019, renewable energy reached 33%, which is the highest
for a third quarter to date [83].
According to Helistö et al. (2017), an increased share of intermittent energy, such as
wind power and solar PV, could lead to longer periods of low electricity prices, which would
entail a lower average electricity cost [83]. The electricity price range would, however,
not change since periods of low intermittent energy generation would still be covered by
fuel-powered power plants and hydropower.
The electricity spot price is not the only electricity cost that the final consumers
stand for. The grid tax and other levies represent a substantial part of the net electricity
cost. These taxes and levies vary from country to country, and they are also different for
household and non-household consumers. In the EU, Germany has the highest total cost of
electricity (including the spot price, taxes and levies) for household consumers. The average
total cost of electricity for household consumers in Germany was 0.3088 EUR/kWh in 2019.
The corresponding cost for Latvia, the EU country with the lowest household electricity
costs, was 0.1629 EUR/kWh. The average electricity prices, with and without taxes and
levies, of Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy are presented in Table 7.

5. Results and Discussion
5.1. Renewable Energy Generation Methods for PEDs
As noted in Section 4, the energy generation potential of renewable energy technologies varies between different regions within the EU. A renewable energy technology that
excels in one region might be impossible to implement in another region. The geographical
location and its properties must therefore be taken into account when planning a PED.
Solar PV is a good example of an energy technology that is highly dependent on the
geographical location. In northern Europe, where there are only a few hours of daylight
in the winter season, solar PV generation is significantly lower than in southern Europe.
Hence, the capital costs per kWh of generated solar power are significantly higher in the
Nordic countries compared to the Mediterranean region. The situation is similar for wind
power, which is naturally more remunerative in windy areas, such as the regions close to
the northern Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea and parts of the Mediterranean Sea.
Different renewable energy technologies also have different properties when it comes
to flexibility, cost and service life [32]. Intermittent renewable energy generation technologies, such as solar and wind energy, are considered non-flexible energy sources, as they can
only generate energy when the wind speed and solar radiation are sufficient. Run-of-river
hydropower is more flexible than solar and wind energy, but not as flexible as reservoir
hydropower and bioenergy.
The installation costs, costs of electricity and service lives of different renewable energy
technologies are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix A. However, the installation cost is

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

19 of 30

dependent on the size and location of the installation, and the cost of electricity is highly
dependent on the geographic location [32]. Hence, the costs in the table are given as global
weighted averages.
The diversification of intermittent renewable energy technologies is a great way to
increase the demand coverage and reduce life cycle costs [86,87]. Intermittent renewable
energy technologies, such as wind and solar energy, are often able to compensate each
other, as windy and sunny periods are not synchronized. As the energy export price is
often lower than the energy import price for small-scale energy producers [88], it might
be beneficial for a PED to minimize the external grid interaction. By diversifying the
intermittent renewable energy generation, it would be possible to achieve a positive annual
energy balance with a lower export rate [89].
According to a study by Heide et al. (2010), wind power is, in general, more beneficial
in Europe from a load-matching perspective since both the wind power generation and the
energy demand are higher during the winter than during the summer [86]. Solar energy
generation, on the other hand, is the highest during the summer months. Thus, from a
load-matching point of view, a larger share of the PED energy generation mix should be
covered by wind energy in most of Europe. This is, however, not that simple, as installing
wind turbines in populated areas is complicated and solar energy is, on a global level,
a more cost-effective energy generation method [32].
In most districts, especially in densely populated areas, space is also an issue. Renewable energy systems must thus be integrated in a smart way, so that energy generation does
not conflict with other functions that are essential for the district. Solar power integration
in urban districts is convenient since solar PVs, CSPs and solar heat collectors can be
installed on rooftops and various available surfaces within districts. Solar PV panels can
also be integrated into building façades. So-called building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV)
can be integrated in stable and heavy structural elements as well as in lightweight and
transparent structural elements [90]. According to a study by Fath et al. (2015), building
façades provide almost three times the area of roofs in a 2 km2 urban area in Karlsruhe,
Germany [91]. However, due to their angles and positions, they receive only 41% of the
total solar irradiation. Hence, solar PV panels on roofs should be prioritized in PEDs,
while façade solar PV panels can be considered if the solar radiation on a particular façade
is sufficient. Overall, city-integrated solar PVs have a great potential and can satisfy over
60% of the electricity demand in some smaller cities in Europe [92,93].
Wind power integration in urban areas, on the other hand, does have many practicality
issues and is thus less suitable for on-site energy generation in PEDs. It would be complicated to install large-scale wind turbines due to their size, aesthetics and noise as well as
low and turbulent urban wind-speed and safety issues [94,95]. Small-scale wind turbines
could be an option, but their cost per installed kWh is about twice as high as large-scale
turbines [32,96]. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are a popular alternative among
small-scale wind turbines. These wind turbines are able to handle the higher turbulence
and varied wind speeds associated with urban environments [94]. Another benefit with
VAWTs is that the generator can be installed at a lower part of the so-called tower, allowing
building-mounted turbines to be more easily serviced [94]. The hub height of small-scale
urban wind turbines is, however, not high enough to access the same wind speeds as
large-scale wind turbines [97].
Due to the many shortcomings of wind turbine installations in urban areas, wind power
is best suited for virtual power plants. The distance between the district and the virtual
wind power farm could, however, be relatively short and thereby ease the power transmission to the district. Wind farms could, for instance, be installed in nearby rural areas or
even offshore if the district is in a coastal area.
Bioenergy and hydropower can be used to provide PEDs with flexible power when the
intermittent energy generation is lower than the electricity demand [98,99]. These flexible
power generation methods make the district less dependent on electricity supplied by the
external grid and thereby foster a positive annual energy balance.

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

20 of 30

Bioenergy plants can be built almost anywhere in Europe, as biomass is relatively
cheap to transport from biomass-producing regions, such as the Nordic countries, the Baltic
countries and Austria [50], to other parts of Europe. Bioenergy generation does, however,
produce emissions, which contradicts the PED’s aim to provide a carbon-free energy
environment and better life quality in residential areas. Even though bioenergy is carbon
neutral from a life-cycle perspective (as the carbon dioxide emissions originate from carbon
dioxide captured from the atmosphere by biomass), this does not change the fact that
bioenergy plants pollute the air in the district where they operate.
Hydropower, on the other hand, is extremely dependent on the location of the district
since hydropower can only be generated in regions that satisfy the requirements described
in Section 4.1.3. Most of the potential hydropower sites in Europe are already in use or
unattainable due to regulations and environmental protection [100]. Hence, hydropower is
best suited for a virtual power plant for virtual PEDs, where the district boundaries are
virtual instead of geographic. According to Graabak et al. (2019), a 2050 Central-West
European grid with large shares of intermittent renewable energy could benefit from using
Norwegian hydropower as flexible energy for grid balancing [98].
Heat pumps are expected to provide a significant share of future heating [101]. Due to
the flexibility and high coefficient of performance (COP) of modern heat pumps [101],
they could be a highly valued source for heating in future PEDs. Due to the relatively large
operating temperature interval, heat pumps can be used to recover low temperature heat
from the ground and the ambient air as well as low temperature waste heat from sewage
systems, ventilation air and other waste heat flows. Heat pumps are thus able to increase
the total energy efficiency of PEDs and minimize the import of externally generated thermal
energy. Moreover, heat pumps provide additional flexibility to PEDs, as they can be used
to transform electrical energy into heat that can be stored in TESs [88]. It is thereby possible
to reach a higher utilization rate for electricity generated by on-site intermittent renewable
energy technologies.
5.2. Energy Storage Methods for PEDs
Energy storage enables PEDs to store excess energy instead of exporting it. Hence,
energy storage can be used to increase the on-site utilization of intermittent energy sources,
such as solar and wind. This is particularly important for self-sufficient PEDs, so-called
autonomous PEDs, as they are not allowed to import energy from the external grid. For dynamic PEDs, energy storage is not as crucial since they allow bidirectional interaction
between the district and its surroundings, and can thereby use the external grid to balance
the energy demand during periods of low on-site energy generation.
Table A2 in the Appendix A presents the installation costs, energy densities, lifetimes
and round-trip efficiencies of different energy storage technologies that can be utilized in
PEDs. Based on this table, the most cost-effective energy storage methods are pumped
hydro and compressed air energy storage. As explained earlier in the paper, these energy
storage methods are extremely dependent on the geographical characteristics of the site,
and hence, they are not possible to implement anywhere [61]. Another issue with these
storage methods is their low energy density, which makes it difficult to install them in
densely populated districts [61].
Pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage do, however, have great potential
as virtual energy storage. A virtual PED with a periodical intermittent energy surplus and
shortage could, for example, interact with virtual storage located far from the geographical
location of the district itself. Similar energy management strategies have, for instance,
been implemented between Denmark and Norway, where excess Danish wind power is
stored in pumped hydro storage in Norway [102]. This collaboration between nations is
possible due to the high level of wind power generation in Denmark (>20% of the annual
electricity generation) and the enormous pumped hydro storage potential in the mountains
of Norway.

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

21 of 30

Batteries, on the other hand, are not so reliant on the geographical site of the PED,
but they are considerably more expensive than pumped hydro storage and compressed air
storage [60]. It is therefore often more cost-effective for dynamic PEDs to interact with the
electricity grid than to use batteries [26]. The combination of decreasing battery prices and
an increasing share of intermittent energy in the electricity grid could, however, open up
more opportunities for batteries in the future.
Even if pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage would be an available
option for autonomous PEDs, it could be beneficial to also install a battery for short-term
energy storage. Batteries have a significantly shorter reaction time and can thereby add
more flexibility to the energy system of the district and increase the utilization of on-site
intermittent renewable energy [103].
Compared to electricity storage systems, TES systems are relatively cheap to install [72].
Sensible heat storage in the form of hot/warm water tanks is, by far, the most common
TES method for heating and domestic hot water applications [104]. Short-term energy
storage can be implemented at the building level without causing significant heat losses.
The storage temperatures of these forms of storage are usually kept at 55–60 ◦ C in order to
avoid bacterial growth [104].
When heat is stored for longer periods, heat losses become an issue. As heat losses
can be minimized by increasing the water volume and lowering the storage temperature,
it might be beneficial to implement centralized low-temperature systems for long-term or
seasonal TES [71]. The temperature of these TESs can be increased by utilizing heat pumps.
5.3. Possibility of Implementing Virtual Power Plants in PEDs
Virtual PEDs allow renewable energy systems to be installed outside the geographical
boundaries of the district. Renewable energy generation systems that cannot be installed
within the geographical boundaries of a PED can be implemented as so-called virtual
power plants (VPPs). According to Next Kraftewerke, the operator of one of Europe’s
largest VPPs [105], a VPP is “a network of decentralized, medium-scale power-generating
units such as wind farms, solar parks, and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, as well
as flexible power consumers and storage systems” [106]. The power generated by the
interconnected units is distributed by a centralized control system to the energy consumers.
Nevertheless, the power-generating units remain independent in their operation and
ownership [106].
The type and size of on-site renewable energy systems and energy storage systems are
often restricted by regulations as well as limited and unsuitable conditions. By utilizing
the VPP concept, a PED could own and operate renewable energy systems and energy
storage outside its geographical boundaries, which would enable the PED to access a
greater geographical area and more suitable conditions for renewable energy generation
and energy storage. The utilization of VPPs could also be implemented through agreements
with other energy market actors instead of the ownership of the renewable energy systems
and energy storage [107].
VPPs could benefit PEDs in several ways. They can enable the PED to utilize a larger
variety of renewable energy systems as well as long-term low-cost energy storage with low
energy densities, and thereby increase the flexibility of the PED. According to a study by
Vasirani et al. (2013), a combination of wind and electric vehicle energy storage in a VPP
could also have a synergetic impact from an economic point of view [108].
5.4. District Heating/Cooling and Electricity Networks
Due to the surge in heat pump installations during the last decade, electricity grids and
district heating and cooling networks are becoming more and more interconnected [101,109].
Thanks to heat pumps, energy systems can reach a higher degree of flexibility, as energy
can be converted from electricity to heat with high COPs.
The reduction of fossil fuel CHP plants in the energy generation mix would require
a more sophisticated district heating network that is better suited for decentralized heat-

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

22 of 30

ing. This field has recently received increased attention from researchers, and hence, the
properties of the next generation, i.e., the fourth generation, of district heating and cooling
networks have been investigated and discussed in several research papers [110–113].
The fourth generation district heating (4GDH) network will be an integrated part of
smart energy systems and thus able to interact with other components, such as heat pumps,
solar heat collectors and TESs [110]. Hence, the 4GDH networks rely on the optimized distribution, consumption and interaction between renewable energy sources [112]. Another key
objective of the 4GDH network is to enable heat recovery from low-temperature sources
and to decrease the temperature of both the supply and return district heating water [110].
The low temperature of the district heating network district also benefits heat pumps,
as their efficiency is higher for lower output temperatures [101].
District cooling solutions are also a relatively new technology, and they are not as
widely used as traditional district heating [101], but they can be implemented with the
same operating principles as the 4GDH networks [110]. District cooling is usually supplied
by natural cold resources, absorption chillers, mechanical chillers and cold storage [114].
During periods when heating and cooling demands are occurring simultaneously, synergies
between the district cooling and heating networks can be utilized by using heat pumps to
produce cold and warm water at the same time [114].
Both 4GDH and district cooling can be implemented as local networks (to which
all energy consumers and producers are connected) in the PED with connections to the
external district heating and cooling networks. This way, PEDs can balance their internal
heating and cooling demands before exporting or importing energy from the external
network. The same principles can also be applied to the electricity grid in the district.
In order to streamline the utilization of such local energy networks, centralized control
systems can be implemented. A centralized control system can optimize the energy flows
between energy consumers, producers and storage in the PED so that the economic benefit
of the PED is maximized.
Connections to the district heating/cooling network and electricity grid are an essential part of the PED concept, as one of the main targets of a PED is to interact with
other PEDs and provide renewable energy to other parts of the metropolitan area. Hence,
the energy transfer connections in and out of the district must be carefully planned and
designed based on the purpose and capacity of the PED energy system.
5.5. Construction of PED Networks
Cities can be very different when it comes to size, population, population density,
economic situation, public transportation, etc., and consequently, there are also significant
differences in energy consumption. Cities in cold and hot climates consume a large amount
of energy for heating and cooling, respectively [94]. Industrial cities also also consume
more energy; however, they usually have a greater potential for district heating [94].
Even within the same city, there can be considerable variations in energy consumption
between different districts [94]. According to a study by Jones and Kammen (2011), there is
a clear correlation between income and household energy consumption [115]. Additionally,
the energy consumption per household of big American metropolitan areas is usually
higher in the suburbs than in the urban cores, due to longer driving distances and bigger
homes [116]. All in all, there are numerous factors that affect the energy usage of cities and
districts within cities, and therefore, it is impossible to develop specific PED construction
guidelines that can be applied to every district in every city.
The high population density of urban cores complicates the installation of renewable
energy systems. The population density does, however, usually decrease as the distance
to the city centre grows, and therefore, it is easier to install renewable energy systems
in the suburbs, where there is more space in relation to the number of residents. Hence,
we propose an onion model for PED networks, where most of the PEDs are constructed
in the outer-most layers, i.e., the districts furthest away from the city centre. These outerlayer PEDs produce more renewable energy than they consume and can thereby export

Buildings 2021, 11, 19

excess renewable energy to the inner layers of the city. This way, networks of PEDs can

increase the renewable energy share of the city centre and the self-sufficiency of the 24

community and its shareholders cannot, however, be engaged in large-scale commercial
activity in the energy sector.
The legislative features of energy communities might benefit the PEDs since they
reduce the economic friction between renewable energy producers and consumers within
the community. Regulations might, however, prohibit PEDs defined as energy communities
from exporting energy to the external electricity grid and district heating network, as energy
communities are not allowed to engage in commercial energy trading.
6. Conclusions
A general survey of the renewable energy market circumstances in different parts of
Europe is provided to form a conception of the potential for implementing PEDs in the EU.
The capitals of four different EU countries, representing four EU regions, were examined
with extra care to highlight the variation in the renewable energy environment within the
EU. Based on this survey, it can be concluded that the techno-economic potential of different
renewable energy and energy storage technologies varies between different EU countries
and cities. The economic viability of wind power is, for instance, greater in regions close
to the Northern Atlantic than in the heart of Central Europe. Other factors that affect the
renewable energy market circumstances of a region are the energy consumption behaviour
and the electricity prices. High energy prices and suitable energy demand profiles might
enhance the implementation of renewable energy systems and PEDs.
Three different PED definitions are presented in the paper: autonomous PED, dynamic
PED and virtual PED. The difference between the definitions is their ability to interact with
energy networks, consumers and producers outside the geographical boundaries of the
PED. These PED definitions serve as the foundation of the PED concept in this paper.
An analysis was conducted to further investigate the available technologies and
concepts that can be used for PEDs and networks of PEDs. Here, it was found that not all
available renewable energy and energy storage technologies are suitable for all types of
PEDs. Due to the high population density of modern European cities, some technologies
are only possible to implement as VPPs for virtual PEDs. These VPPs are renewable
energy generation and energy storage systems that are installed outside the geographical
boundaries of the district. Examples of technologies that are best suited as VPPs are wind
power and hydropower as well as large-scale energy storages, such as pumped hydro
and CAES. Solar PV and batteries, on the other hand, are more suitable for an urban
environment and are thus possible to install in all types of PEDs.
As a part of the analysis, the authors also proposed a unique onion model for constructing PED networks. According to this model, the majority of the PEDs are placed in
the outskirts of the city, and the excess energy generated from these PEDs is exported to
the more central areas in the city, where the renewable energy installations are not able to
fulfil the energy demand. This way, it would be possible to increase the renewable energy
share of the whole city.
In a regulation analysis, we found that there are several regulations and policies that
benefit the implementation of PEDs throughout the EU. The European Green Deal and
the Clean Energy Package are examples of EU initiatives that are in line with the targets
of the PED. The Clean Energy Package has contributed to one of the most significant
legislative advancements in favour of the PED concept, as the package recognizes the rights
of communities and citizens to engage directly in the energy sector.
The PED definition is still in a conceptualization phase, and further research is therefore needed in order to initiate a discussion on a societal level. More studies on the
technological and economic viability of the PED are required, as well as comparative studies with other renewable energy solutions. A comparison between centralized large-scale
renewable energy systems and PED-like distributed renewable energy systems would
be a particularly interesting research topic. Another topic that would need to be further
investigated is the resilience of PEDs and how PEDs are able to handle various types of
failures in the local energy system.
