Abstract
Remote area electrification is a major concern for a government of any developing nation. India is also working for it but despite
continuous efforts towards remote area electrification, several thousand households in India are un-electrified. Several schemes have
been launched by Government for electrification of such areas through grid extension but still many areas have not been covered under
the proposed schemes due to economic, environmental and geographical reasons. Narayanpur district in Chhattisgarh state of India has
un-electrified regions and various issues like poor literacy, untreated water facility and lack of access to communication networks. In
order to find viable option of electricity supply to this region, a case study has been performed for the feasibility of off-grid floating
photovoltaic (PV) system, on-ground PV system and grid extension along with their comparative analysis with respect to certain
parameters i.e. net present value (NPV), cost of energy (CoE), environment cleanliness and social acceptance. Floating PV and onground PV systems have been designed and simulated using System Adviser Model (SAM) software developed by National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA. The results show that floating PV system has lowest CoE of $0.0598/kWh and least
negative NPV of $185,431 as compared to other two options. However, it is found that floating PV system achieves positive NPV of
$38,968 in 28th year of project life.

Electrification of remote villages in developing countries is a
prime agenda for every government in order to set a path for
development. Indian government also, in its National
Electricity Plan 2016, had committed for universal access to
electricity by the end of 2019 [1]. In this direction, there have
been many schemes announced in India but a considerable
numbers of people still live without access to electricity
(World Energy Outlook, 2020) [2]. Majority of these people
live in rural areas which are still waiting for electricity. Since
electricity has become a basic need for human being, it is
highly essential that electricity should reach un-electrified rural areas to make people cope up with the developing pace of
the world.
This study has been performed for finding solution to issues of lack of electricity in some areas of Chhattisgarh state
of India. Chhattisgarh state has high electrification rate but
still several thousand households from rural and urban areas
are un-electrified. Some of these households have been

6 Page 2 of 10

covered under Rajiv Gandhi Gram Vikas Yojna1 (RGGVY),
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana2 (DDUGJY) and
Decentralized Distributed Generation (DDG) schemes of
Govt. of India for rural electrification. There are some areas
in Bastar region which are not covered under any such scheme
yet. Narayanpur district is one such region which came into
existence in the year 2007 after it was carved out from Bastar
district. As per world population projections 2020,
Narayanpur district has least population of 159,395 in
Chhattisgarh state. It has a very less rate of electrification
because of its remote location. It has a literacy rate of
48.12%. Also, only 7.6% primary and 24.8% upper primary
schools have their access to electricity. Very less rural households have drinking water facility and treated tap water facility
which leads to lots of health issues. The district has a very
poor communication facility either it be landline, mobile
phones or internet facility [3].
There are several reasons behind the lack of electricity in
this area. The issues are as follows:
(i) The area has issues related to antisocial activities of left
wing extremism (LWE) along with the poor transportation and communication.
(ii) Narayanpur has a forest cover of over 71% which leads
to scattered population i.e. out of 4143 households, an
average of only 28 households exist per village. This
distributed population will increase the number of transmission and distribution lines if opted for grid extension.
(iii) Grid extension will require deforestation which surely
causes a high right of way (ROW) cost. In Narayanpur
district, as per the state government report [4], 4143
households require 3.3463 billion dollars for electrification, i.e. 0.808 million dollars per household. The another fact is that most of the population (about 70%) live
in these deep forests from where they collect their food,
medicines and household materials. Thus, deforestation
of these areas is not at all advisable for electrification
from cost and social point of view.
In view of above discussed three reasons, renewable energy based distributed generation (DG) has been sought as viable option due to recent advances in renewable energy technologies and utility infrastructures [5]. These facts are the
motivation behind the present work towards finding solution
in terms of floating PV or on-ground PV system. The paper

Rajeev Gandhi Gram Vikas Yojna was started in April, 2005 with an aim to
provide electricity to poor families in India. Under this scheme, all the poor
families are given free electricity connections. The 90% of financial grant
provided to this scheme comes from central government.

Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana is a scheme of government of
India and has aim to provide continuous electricity supply to rural areas. This
was started in November 2014 by central government with a mission to electrify 18,452 rural and un-electrified villages.

also presents comparative analysis of floating PV and onground PV system with grid extension based on parameters
like cost, reliability, effect on environment and social acceptance by the area people.
Solar energy system has been considered for analysis as it
is one of the most promising renewable energy due to its clean
and free availability over the years and once the system is
installed it can be maintained by the local people only. One
of the limitations associated with solar energy is that it suffers
from the drawback of huge land requirement which is a major
issue since it will require deforestation at huge scale and this
may not be cost effective in the present case. Hence, floating
PV system may be a feasible solution and it can be installed
over available cannels, ponds and dam water reservoirs. These
systems may save cost and reduce the social un-acceptance
risk involved in deforestation. Floating PV systems produce
greater power output since it has higher PV system efficiency
due to cooling effect of water. Floating PV can also help in
reducing water evaporation and retaining water quality.
Many researchers have worked and presented studies
wherein the requirement of electricity in rural areas and its
impact on the society development along with certain limitations have been discussed. Malakar [6] has given a qualitative
approach to enhance the capabilities of people of Chittoor,
Andhra Pradesh state of India by electrification and has
discussed various social factors being affected badly in unelectrified villages. The author has given an insight of the
drawbacks that exist in the political system and has suggested
solutions to overcome these issues. Saxena et al. [7] have
presented role of caste, tribe and religion in power consumption inequalities and differences in the use of Liquefied
Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a clean cooking fuel in India. Aklin
et al. [8] have conducted survey in six states of India and
discussed about social acceptance to the off-grid solar technology in India. Various factors such as poverty, inequality
and the new technology issues were discussed followed by its
solutions suggested to Government for establishing clean
form of solar energy for rural villages’ electrification which
will make a substantial improvement in socio-environment
factor. Sahu et al. [9] have discussed different floating PV
design options and given information regarding present floating PV availability in India. Choi [10] has given a comparative
analysis between On-ground and floating PV system and concluded that floating PV system possess 11% more generating
efficiency than that of On-Ground system. PV modules in
floating system were found to have less temperature rise because of the cooling effects of water [10]. Gisbert et al. [11]
have discussed the design aspects of floating systems and
prepared both technical and economical feasibility of the system. Song et al. [12] proposed installation of floating PV system on mine pit lakes and calculated NPV, payback period
and economical and technical parameters using SAM software
and presented a comparative analysis between floating PV and

Technol Econ Smart Grids Sustain Energy (2021) 6: 6

an On-Ground system. Also, floating PV system proved reduction in GHG emissions twice as compared to On-land PV
systems which were installed after deforestation.
Kumar et al. [13] presented 10 MW PV plant design aspects along with its annual performance parameter. They have
calculated various types of power losses and performance ratios followed by results comparisons using PVsyst and PVGIS softwares. Adefarati et al. [14] have presented the benefits
of using renewable energy sources for reliability, environment
and economics parameters like cost of energy, life cycle cost,
the annual cost of load loss and life cycle greenhouse gas
emission cost. Razmjoo et al. [15] have performed technoeconomical analysis for combined utilization of solar, wind
and diesel energy for supplying selected load of Semirom city
of Iran and presented economic viability of renewable energy
use. Kumar et al. [16] have designed a hybrid standalone
Wind-PV-Battery system to supply electricity for technical
university campus located in north-west Indian state
Rajasthan and found that optimal generation unit price is compatible with grid extension case. Gorjian et al. [17] have presented extensive research on technical advancements, economics and environmental impacts of floating PV systems.
They have performed deep analysis on CAPEX, levelized cost
of energy (COE) and impact of local environment on PV
module support structures.
It was found that there is requirement of work which will
find the feasibility of electricity availability from different
possible and potential ways based on internal rate of return
(IRR), net present value (NPV), cost of energy (COE), social
acceptance, impact on environment and CO2 emissions points
of view. The presented work is different in the sense that it
does comparison of three systems, i.e. floating PV, On-ground
PV and Grid extension system, based on seven parameters
which cover various cost, environment and social aspects.

Proposed Site Assessment for Necessary Prior
Information
As discusses before, three systems have been analysis for their
feasibility in terms of various parameters. The assessment of
site for installation of a system is prime important before its
design and simulation. The site has been assessed for necessary information regarding system requirements and need of
electricity.

Site Assessment for Grid Extension System
Extension of grid line from nearest substation to village areas
is a tedious job due to existence of dense forest region.
Chhattisgarh state power transmission company limited
(CSPTCL) has planned to install a 220/132 kV substation in
Narayanpur district. The power will be transmitted and

Page 3 of 10 6

distributed to un-electrified villages through this substation.
This work will require deforestation of around 20 km area in
length for grid extension.

Solar Resource and Site Temperature Assessment
The potential of solar radiations required for PV systems has
been assessed by collecting the data from NASA meteorological department’s website [18]. The average solar radiation at
the project site is found to be 5.34 kWh/m2/day. Month wise
average daily radiations are shown in Fig. 1(a) where it can be
seen that April and May are the months of higher radiations.
The ambient temperature profile is shown in Fig. 1(b) which
shows considerable variations season wise.

Site Assessment for Floating PV System
Floating PV systems are installed over water reservoirs, canals, rivers, etc. The present system has been proposed on
P.V. Pakhanjor dam reservoir located in Narayanpur district,
Chhattisgarh, India built across Godavari river. It has a length
of 518 m and its reservoir surface area covers 18 km2 as seen
in Fig. 2 which shows the satellite view of the project location
[19]. The meteorological and other characteristics of the site
are given in Table 1. The availability of this huge reservoir
surface area of 18 km2 ensures the potential for the installation
of a floating PV system of sufficiently large capacity equal to
2.5 MW which will certainly fulfil the electricity requirement
of people of this area to a great extent.

Site Assessment for on-Ground System
There is enough ground space present in the area for installation of On-ground PV system. Here, installation of PV system
on 12.7 acre ground will require deforestation of more than
70% of the land. Different types of trees present in forests of
Bastar are Sal, Teak, Bijasal, Sirsa, Palas, Kusum, Imli,
Mahua, Harra, Tendu, Salai, Kanha, Dhowara, and Achar
[20].

Technical and Economical Data for Various
Systems Design
For performance analysis of all the three systems, various
technical and economical data have been used. These data
are detailed in next sections for individual systems separately.

On Ground PV System
The configuration of On-ground PV system is shown in Fig. 3.

To find the number of modules, number of inverters, spacing between arrays, etc., various mathematical equations have
been used by SAM. These equations [22] are described as

Floating PV System
SAM doesn’t have facility to simulate floating PV systems
which have installation structures different and costlier as
compared to that of On-ground PV systems. The values of
technical and cost parameters considered for PV modules,
inverter and battery bank are same as those in the Onground system. The capital expenditure including installation
cost is 1.2 times more than that of On-ground system [10]
because of the requirement of special frames and supporting
system to make it floating. A typical floating structure is
shown in Fig. 4 [22]. Land cost is eliminated in case of floating PV system, since it is distributed over the water. Thus,
total capital expenditure is calculated to be $ 3,009,248. The
power output of floating PV system is experimentally found to
be 11% more than the On-ground system [10] due to lower
surrounding temperature above water surface.

Chhattisgarh state and central government of India jointly, a
power grid line to electrify 4123 households is required to be
erected and commissioned. The grid line has not been considered for erection till now because of inaccessibility issues,
security concerns and un-acceptance of local people to deforestation. The state government has demanded $6.65 billion
from Indian central government to be used for solving
discussed issues and electrification. Thus it is estimated that
$0.808 million per household will be the expenditure on average basis.

Results and Discussions

selected village load is shown in Fig. 5. As seen, during the
lower temperature months from October to March, the power
output is higher as compared to summer and rainy season
months. The project lifetime was assumed to be 25 years
and the economical data, i.e. EBITDA and annual costs along
with annual energy production is shown in Table 3. The zero
year is the year of capital investment at the starting of the
project and thus the annual cost is shown negative for this
time stamp. It can be seen that EBITDA and annual energy
production is reducing as the PV system gets older with increasing time stamp. This is due to the fact that PV module
efficiency reduces with time and thus lower energy output
affects the EBITDA also.

annual energy production have been obtained as shown in
Table 4. This energy output is calculated for lighting 4123
households and also found that one house consumes
914 kWh per year. Since, ambient temperature for floating
PV systems is lower as compared to that in case of onground PV systems, the energy output of former is found
11% more [10] and so calculated energy due to lower temperature effect is shown in an additional column in Table 4. Thus,
extra average energy of 414,618 kWh/year may be utilised to
electrify another 454 houses. Extra energy production from
floating PV system results in reduction of cost of energy per

Grid Extension Systems Results
As specified earlier, erection of grid line along with solution of
other social issues requires initial capital expenditure of $6.65
billion. For the same load profile, number of kWh units supplied from grid is same as that from on-ground PV system.
The price of grid electricity per kWh is taken to be $0.085
which will be revenue for the generating unit. Taking profit on

would be $0.017. Based on numbers of units generated per
year and benefit per unit, loan real discount rate of 6%, the

where Ct and Rt are cost and revenue in tth year respectively, N
is project lifetime in years, I0 is the initial capital cost and i is
the real discount rate. After putting all the data, the NPV has
been calculated to be negative and equal to $6,649,988,981
for considered project life of 25 years. The internal rate of
return (IRR) is the discount rate at which NPV calculation is
zero, i.e. when costs will become equal to benefits. IRR could
not be achieved in the lifetime of 25 years of the project.

Feasibility Comparative Analysis among Three
Systems
As discussed in previous sections, the results of three systems
have been obtained. Based on few selected key parameters,
the comparative analysis is shown in Table 5. As seen from
the table, the floating PV system has lowest cost of energy
along with its positive impact on society and environment.
Floating PV system is acceptable to society because it does
not require deforestation which affects livelihood of local people. NPV for all the systems is found negative for 25 years of
project lifetime but this is found lowest for floating PV system. However, it is found that floating PV system achieves
positive NPV of $38,968 in 28th year of project life. Positive
NPV for on-ground PV system and grid extension could not
be achieved even after 50 years for project inception. Better
cost parameters for floating PV system in spite of its higher

installation costs are due to its higher efficiency and capital
cost saving for no land requirement in its erection. Floating
PV systems also help increase reservoir water level which will
increase power generation capacity of a hydro power plant if
installed on it. The on-ground PV system’s impact on environment is conditionally positive since it depends on trade-off
between its clean energy production and amount of deforestation performed.
Since PV is an intermittent source and the solar radiations
vary with location, a sensitivity analysis has been performed
for changing solar radiations with change in latitude and longitude. The effect of variations in average solar radiations
(ASR) on various parameters has been shown in Table 6 for
both on-ground PV and floating PV systems. It can be seen
that as the solar radiations increase from 5 to 5.47 kWh/m2/d,
the effect is positive on both the systems with respect to all the
parameters i.e. NPV, IRR, average energy produced per year
and levelized cost of energy.

not be feasible options. Thus floating PV systems can be a
proven way to solve electrification issues of very remote and
dense forest areas availing water reservoirs.

Conclusion
The problem of electrification of a remote village of
Chhattisgarh state in India was addressed by analysing three
systems feasibility analysis from technical, economical and
social point of view. The three systems considered were onground PV system, floating PV system and grid extension
system. Two PV systems were designed and simulated using
SAM software and their results were compared with grid extension systems parameters also. Key parameters selected for
comparative analysis were NPV, IRR, cost of energy, social
acceptance, impact on environment and CO2 emissions. From
all the aspects, floating PV system was found best feasible
solution. NPV for all the systems were found negative in
25 years of project life but floating PV systems attains positive
NPV in 28th year of its lifetime. In the world, there are many
places where deforestation is of great concern from environmental aspects, grid extension and on-ground PV system may
