Abstract: Solar photovoltaic (PV) is becoming one of the most significant renewable sources for
positive energy district (PED) in Sweden. The lack of innovative business models and financing
mechanisms are the main constraints for PV’s deployment installed in local communities. This paper
therefore proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) business model for 48 individual building prosumers with
PV installed in a Swedish community. It considers energy use behaviour, electricity/financial flows,
ownerships and trading rules in a local electricity market. Different local electricity markets are
designed and studied using agent-based modelling technique, with different energy demands,
cost–benefit schemes and financial hypotheses for an optimal evaluation. This paper provides an
early insight into a vast research space, i.e., the operation of an energy system through the constrained
interaction of its constituting agents. The agents (48 households) show varying abilities in exploiting
the common PV resource, as they achieve very heterogeneous self-sufficiency levels (from ca. 15% to
30%). The lack of demand side management suggests that social and lifestyle differences generate
huge impacts on the ability to be self-sufficient with a shared, limited PV resource. Despite the
differences in self-sufficiency, the sheer energy amount obtained from the shared PV correlates mainly
with annual cumulative demand.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background and Literature Review
Positive energy districts (PED) are defined as energy-efficient and energy-flexible building areas
with surplus renewable energy production and net zero greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Solar photovoltaic
(PV) is ideally a leading renewable source in PEDs due to its easy scalability, simple installation and
relatively low maintenance. Distributed PV systems are the main driver in the Swedish PV markets, due
to smaller size and distributed ownership, which are better adapted to permeate the urban environment.
The installed capacity of PV systems in Sweden is expected to continuously soar in the future, mainly
driven by homeowners and private or public companies at relatively small or medium scales, according
to its particular market setup and subsidy (e.g., SOLROT deduction, tax reduction, etc.) [2]. However,
relying on the subsidy is not sustainable for PV deployment in the long term. At the moment, there is
still limited access to capital and appropriate financing mechanisms, resulting in a slow uptake of PV
under traditional business models (i.e., power purchase agreements and the net-metering mechanism),

which are no longer applicable for small PV systems [3]. The existing business models may need to be
further developed to exploit the full potentials generated by distributed energy supply, demand and
energy sharing. Thus, in a future without subsidies, prosumers (i.e., small PV owners) will have to sell
their excess production at market price back to the grid. This scenario would be unprofitable for PV
owners and also strain grid stability and reduce its reliability.
Fortunately, the possibility to form energy communities, where energy can be locally shared,
has been regulated at European level in the Clean Energy package presented by the European
Commission [4] and at Swedish level under § 22 (a) of the IKN Regulation 2007: 215 [5]. This can be
an opportunity for a new business model development within the energy sector, e.g., Peer-to-Peer
(P2P) trading. In such business model, consumers and prosumers organise in energy communities,
in which the excess production could be sold to other members [6]. The benefits are threefold as the
prosumers could make an additional margin on their sale, consumers could buy electricity at a more
advantageous price and the grid could be more stable and resilient. This can be a potential solution to
promoting PV installation in a sustainable way, while reducing the reliance on subsidies.
To support new regulations, careful design and optimal modelling of P2P business models for PV
penetration is necessary by analysing current scenarios and proposing future ways of exchanging energy.
Huijben and Verbong [3] summarised three possible ownerships of PV systems: customer-owned
(single ownership), community shares (multiple ownership) and third-party ownership. Based on these
possibilities, Lettner et al. [7] further described three different system boundaries of a PV prosumer
business concept (as illustrated in Figure 1): Group (1) single direct use (one consumer directly uses the
generated PV electricity on site); Group (2) local collective use of PV in one building (several consumers
share the generated PV electricity with or without the public grid); and Group (3) district power model
(PVs are installed in several buildings, where those prosumers directly consume locally generated PV
power and the PV electricity is further shared using public or private microgrid). It is possible to have
different ownerships in each category of these boundary conditions, resulting in many possibilities
and uncertainties in the practical business operation. Learning and mapping (i.e., testing) a wide array
of these possible designs and combinations are necessary. There are a few existing regulatory and
modelling studies about the P2P PV-electricity trading. Community-owned PV system was surveyed
as an innovative business model in Switzerland, where it can seemingly be a successful distribution
channel for the further adoption of PV [8]. Roberts et al. tested a range of financial scenarios in
Australia, based on the P2P concept, to increase PV self-consumption and electricity self-efficiency
by applying PVs to aggregated building loads [9]. Zhang et al. [10] established a four-layer system
architecture of P2P energy trading (as shown in Figure 2, i.e., power grid layer, ICT layer, control
layer and business layer), during which they focused on the bidding process on business layer using
non-cooperative game theory in a microgrid with 10 peers. A price mechanism for the aggregated PV
electricity exchange among peer buildings was also developed using either Lagrangian relaxation-based
decentralised algorithm [11] or mixed integer linear programming [12]. Jing et al. [13] then applied
the non-cooperative game theory to modelling the aggregated energy trading between residential
and commercial buildings by considering fair energy pricing mechanism for both PV electricity and
thermal energy simultaneously. Lüth et al. [14] designed two local markets for decentralised storage
(flexi user market-individually owned batteries) and centralised storage (pool hub market-commonly
owned battery), based on a multi-period linear programming. It focused on the evaluation of two
different ownerships of batteries and optimised P2P energy trading local markets. They indicated
that the end users can save up to 31% electricity bills in the Flexi User Market and 24% in Pool Hub
Market. Furthermore, two different ownership structures, namely the third-party owned structure and
the user owned structure, were investigated in a P2P energy sharing network with PV and battery
storage [15]. These existing studies almost cover all four layers of a P2P network. The impact of
other system and market components on the economic performance of PV P2P business models has
been investigated, such as EV (Electric Vehicle) batteries [16], gas storage [17], heat pump/hot water
storage [18], advanced control [19], energy cost optimisation [20], bidding strategies for local free

This paper studies the P2P business model for 48 individual building prosumers with PV installed
in a Swedish community. This paper discovers “latent opportunities” that were previously unknown
and optimises the market design and its variables for the best benefit. It has significant influence that
integrates energy needs, supply and market rules. This paper is expected to provide knowledge for
policymakers to design a fair, effective and economical P2P energy framework. The research results
will useful be to optimise PED’s three functions (energy efficiency, energy production and flexibility)
towards energy surplus and climate neutrality.
2. Materials and Methods
The definition of ownership structures from [3] distinguishes among customers, communities and
third parties. In general, a similar distinction could be applied to the behaviour of the local grid instead
to the ownership. In this way, the concept of ownership is not associated with the functioning of the
grid and it is easier to describe hybrid forms (e.g., some shareholder of an energy provider, or more
providers, which form a market although not prosumers). Thinking about the behaviour of the shared
system, a space can be defined according to three dimensions (see Figure 3):
(1)
(2)

(3)

The controlled versus emergent dimension describes how much there are rules or a controller
that directs the exchanges, versus an emergent behaviour from the interactions between agents.
The centralised versus de-centralised dimension describes how much the agents are equivalent
among each other, versus the presence of few (potentially one) agents that concentrate some
functions for a larger number of others.
The individual versus collective dimension describes how much each agent controls and directs
its own resources (i.e., PV, storage, demand-response resources, etc.), versus having larger pools
of agents who share some common resources.

The behaviour map does not refer to any specific levels [10], although the last two (i.e., controls
and business) are particularly affected from the volume of the map, in which they are located. In fact,
the control of the energy and monetary flows between generation and demand points can be decided
by a controller, which can be assigned by the internal rules of a community or emerged as the result of
an auction.
2.1. Agent-Based Model
Given the number and nature of the emergent behaviours in the behaviour map (i.e., Figure 3),
an agent based model (ABM) simulation was developed to get insight into the energy and economic
fluxes exchanged between the different actors in the local grid. Usually, every agent of the simulation
represents one household in the local grid (i.e., a consumer or a prosumer), but producers are not
excluded. An example of a producer is an energy provider. For instance, companies or investor
interacts with the local grid without necessarily being served by it, or the parent grid, i.e., the larger
grid in which the local grid is embedded. The local grid could be a microgrid but also a secondary
network, where the prosumers are allowed to have a certain level of control of the network.
In an ABM, each agent can interact with all the other agents by trading energy. Thus, it can send
energy in exchange for money or vice versa. The movement of energy in the microgrid is an emergent
behaviour, which results from the interaction of a number of independent actors. This is opposed to a
control algorithm, where the behaviour is set by a series of rules or conditions. Naturally, the freedom
of the agents can be limited by the introduction of rules. For instance, a producer could be forced to
prioritise the sale of renewable electricity to those consumers that have used the least of it in a given
period. If the rules become tighter, the freedom of each individual agent is reduced. While if the rules
are as tight as to completely limit any possibility of choice for the agents, the ABM degenerates into a
control algorithm.
In the present study, the behaviour of the agents is extremely simplified: the consumers prioritise
the purchase of electricity from the cheapest source available at any given time, on the other end the

producers have the ability to set the price, and they do so according to the case as explained in the
following section (i.e., ownership structures and business models). Figure 4 presents the possible
ownership structures arranged into three main families; these are slightly different from those in [3] for
the purpose of this study.

households in the building. This allows for two of the three basic ownership structures in Figure 4
(i.e., LEP and LEC) to be applied. The ownership structure is intertwined with the business model
and the rules of the market. In the following studies, the same communal PV plant is shared between
the households in the local grid in three different scenarios:

1.

LEC gratis: In this arrangement, the electricity from the communal PV plant is given for free

LEP n%: This arrangement is a pure form of LEP. Thus, the production plant is owned by a single
provider who can set the price at its own will. Obviously, the provider cannot set the price higher
than that of the parent grid (i.e., the average price for Swedish household consumer as assumed
in Section 2.3) as the consumers retain the right to purchase electricity from the cheapest source.
In this study, the provider sets the price as half-way between the minimum of the local LCOE and
the maximum of the consumer price from the parent grid. More precisely, the provider sets a
price at a percentage n so that n = 0 is the LCOE, n = 100 is the price offered by the parent grid
and n = 50 is half-way. This set-up is valid under the assumption that the LCOE of the system is
lower than the price of the electricity for the consumer. Of course, if this assumption does not
hold true, the provider will not be able to charge above market price and will thus operate at the
minimum loss.

In all arrangements, the consumer is programmed to buy electricity from the cheapest source.
However, by having a single source in the local grid, the choice is only between the local source and
the parent grid. This implies that the price of electricity in the local grid must be at any time below the
Swedish consumer price. If the local production is absent or insufficient (i.e., local consumption > local
production), the demand shall be covered partially or totally by the parent grid. If the local production
is not sufficient, at a given point in time, to cover entirely the demand, all the households will be served
equally in terms of percentage of their demands as shown in the system of relations in Equation (1).

where Elocal and Ehouse are the amount of electricity available in a given time for the aggregated local
grid and for a specific household, respectively. η is the self-sufficiency: a number between 0 and 1 that
represents the share of the demand covered by locally produced electricity; note that it is the same
globally and for each household. Dlocal and Dhouse represent the aggregated demand and the demand
of each single household, respectively.
Equation (1) implies that having a larger consumption when the local electricity production is
scarce guarantees access to a larger amount of local energy, although equal in percentage. Another
consequence of the relation in (1) involves the price of the electricity for each household: the price
results from the weighted average (weighted on energy) of the prices from the different sources of
electricity purchased. In the specific case of this study, the price can be calculated with the relation
Equation (2):
Phouse = Plocal ·η + Pparent ·(1 − η)
(2)
where Phouse , Plocal and Pparent represent the electricity price for the individual household, the price for
the energy produced locally and the price for the energy bought from the parent grid, respectively. η is
the self-sufficiency as defined for (1).
Considering that η is the same for every household in the local grid as shown in (1), Equation (2)
implies that at any given time there is a unique price of the electricity within the local grid, which depends
on the relation between the aggregated energy demand (Dlocal ) and the aggregate energy production
(Elocal ). Thus, the price for the electricity is solely function of the Hour of the Year (HOY) and is not a
function of any given household.
2.3. Case Study
The agent based model is tested on a digital representation of a moderate size residential district
(see Figure 5) equipped with a shared PV system + DC microgrid as described in [18]. The group of three
buildings with three stories is located in Sunnansjö, Ludvika, Dalarna region, Sweden. The common
PV system is formed by the arrays shown in Table 1. In total, there are three arrays on the roof and one
on the southern façade (total 65.5 kWp).

were assumed as a reasonable price for each single household at the annual cumulative level of

in 2019 was 1.39 SEK/kWh (0.1297 €/kWh) for electricity transmission, system services, distribution

PV self-sufficiency is defined as the share of total demand in a household that is being supplied
by locally generated electricity from PV system [30]. In this study, the system, as it is designed, allows
to cover an estimated 20.2% of the annual cumulative demand of the district. This result is satisfactory
for a system without any electric storage (see [31]). The country, with the most electricity production
from PV (i.e., Honduras), has an estimate PV self-sufficiency of 14.8% with the EU on average having
4.9%. It has been calculated in references [32] and [18] that the economically optimal self-sufficiency
of a conveniently aggregated system, even in absence of electric storage, is comfortably above any
penetration level we see today (i.e., often above 20%). The economically optimal self-sufficiency sets
a conservative limit of hosting capacity in an electrical system in a regime of self-sufficiency. The P50
(i.e., 50th percentile or median) household has a self-sufficiency of 18.5% as shown in Figure 7a: this

demand around 12:00 is particularly prevalent (see Figure 7b). It indicates that its inhabitants cook at
home for lunch. On the other end, the evening peak of the most self-sufficient household is way less
prominent than in the lowest one. Looking at the prevalence throughout the months of the year
(Figure 7c), the difference is less marked compared to the daily average: both households present a
steep drop in sunny months, which seems to indicate an absence due to summer holidays. The most

less prominent than in the lowest one. Looking at the prevalence throughout the months of the year
(Figure 7c), the difference is less marked compared to the daily average: both households present a
steep drop in sunny months, which seems to indicate an absence due to summer holidays. The most
self-sufficient household appears to have had an absence for holidays during May instead of June,
as shown in Figure 7c. This might be advantageous as it allows to use more PV electricity when the
overall electricity demand of the district is lower and the radiation from the sun is higher. It should be
noted that, in general, the best performing household presents a smaller dip in demand for the summer

holidays; it is unknown whether it is due to a shorter holiday or the presence of some household
components at home.
The examples shown in Figure 7 highlight the two apartments that are extreme in terms of
self-sufficiency. To infer more generalised information on the time of high consumption that favours
high self-sufficiency (see Figure 8) the following formula was used:

where ISelfStime step is the influence of high energy demand in a given time step (which could be an
hour of the day or a month of the year). HH stands for Household as the curve results from the sum of
all the individual households. TPtime step, HH and TPtime step, tot are the typical power demand (W) of
said time step for the nth household (HH) and the whole district (tot), respectively. The sum of all time
steps is then rescaled so that it is equal to 1.
In practice, the curve is influenced only by the households that have a self-sufficiency above
average. It represents the influence (positive or negative) that the demand in each time step has on the
overall self-sufficiency. Unsurprisingly, Figure 8a shows that a lower average demand in the evening
and early morning hours is associated with high self-sufficiency. On the contrary, the central hours
of the day are generally above average in highly self-sufficient households. It is interesting to notice

This aspect, although counterintuitive, is a consequence of the highest variability in annual
cumulative demand compared to the variability in self-sufficiency: if in fact the highest selfsufficiency is two times the lowest one, the highest cumulative demand is almost five times the lowest
one (excluding the highest value as an outlier; otherwise, it is more than seven times). The strong
prominence in variability of cumulative demand compared to self-sufficiency reduces the variation
in self-sufficiency as a mere noise compared to the other variable (as visible in Figure 9). Furthermore,

This aspect, although counterintuitive, is a consequence of the highest variability in annual
cumulative demand compared to the variability in self-sufficiency: if in fact the highest self-sufficiency
is two times the lowest one, the highest cumulative demand is almost five times the lowest one
(excluding the highest value as an outlier; otherwise, it is more than seven times). The strong
prominence in variability of cumulative demand compared to self-sufficiency reduces the variation in
self-sufficiency as a mere noise compared to the other variable (as visible in Figure 9). Furthermore, as
self-sufficiency is a share of the demand, it does not have much importance in absolute terms when
applied to households with low cumulative demand. This fact represents somewhat a hindrance as it
implies that increasing overall consumption works better than improving self-sufficiency to seize larger
quantities of scarce local renewable resources. Nevertheless, it is not clear what power an individual
household has to change its cumulative energy demand. Further investigation on the aspects that
influence the cumulative energy demand (e.g., number of people in the household, cooking habits,
holiday habits, etc.) is needed to assess whether it is something that the inhabitants can change. If each
household has significant power on the cumulative energy consumption, it is reasonable to fear a
sharp increase in the overall consumption after the installation of the communal PV system. It should
be acknowledged that the lack of data with respect to other households might focus the attention of
the inhabitants on their own energy demand advising them to increase the self-sufficiency. Another
interesting aspect, shown in Figure 9, is that the linear interpolation of the household data points has a
steeper slope than the average self-sufficiency of the 48 households. This means that the household with
the highest annual cumulative consumption also has, on average, a highest self-sufficiency. The highest
slope of the interpolation implies that at low consumption the self-sufficiency of a household tends
to be lower than average, while at higher consumption tends to be higher. A correlation analysis
between annual cumulative consumption and self-sufficiency found a positive, albeit weak, correlation
(R ≈ 0.2). Although it is weak and thus uncertain, the correlation suggests that highly consuming
households might have more contemporaneity with the production from PV. This might be due to
larger households having some members who stay at home during daytime, or to electric consumption
by people who spend daytime at home being larger overall.
3.3. LEC Gratis
In this arrangement, the households in the district are shareholders of the system. Thus, they can
use the electricity produced by the system for free when available. In this study, the shares of the PV
system are equal. Each household will therefore have to pay 13,646 SEK (1275 €) of initial investment
plus ca. 342 SEK/year (32 €/year) for maintenance and substitution of the inverter. Different ownership
structures are possible, but the business model should be modified to avoid loopholes in the risk–benefit
balance. For instance, equal shares could be distributed to a sub-group of the households (i.e., there are
consumers who do not hold shares). In this case, an electricity price for non-owners should be
established (see Section 2.2 LEP n%).
Figure 10 shows the difference in price between the energy offered by the parent grid and the
energy available within the local system. The chart shows monthly values, which refer to the average
cost of the electricity that month in the grid. We know from the Section 2.1 “Ownership structures
and business models” that at any given time the price of the electricity is unique within the microgrid
and depends on the relationship between production of PV and demand (see Equations (1) and (2)).
The bars in Figure 10 are the average of all electricity prices of the respective month weighted by
the aggregated electric consumption in that month. Obviously, since the energy not met by the local
production is bought from the parent-grid, the external price has an influence on the internal one.
In simpler terms, the internal price of the electric energy in one month, according to Equation (2)
with Plocal = 0, is proportional to the residual demand. Notice that, due to the higher external price,
the drop in cost of electricity during the months of March (Month 3) is similar to that in April (Month
4) despite a lower self-sufficiency.

Notice how with n = 0% (i.e., the electricity sold at production cost of 0.83 SEK/kWh), the balance
and thus the IRR result are negative. This is because the self-consumption of the system is not 100%
(it is in fact ca. 85%). In other words, not all the energy produced by the PV system is consumed by
the households in the local grid. Therefore, part of the production is sold to the grid below LCOE
and results in a moderate loss over the lifetime. The existence of this loss justifies the use of a LCOE
adjusted for self-consumption, as described in [18]. This loss also explains why, under LEC LCOE
arrangement, some households experience economic losses over the lifetime when the electricity by
the communal system is given at price of cost (see Figure 11b). When the electricity is sold at LCOE,
the IRR of the PV system is negative, thus holding its shares leads to a loss unless the benefit for
cheaper energy outweighs the costs.
Applying an n = 9.43% does not result in any loss or gain over the lifetime of the system. It can be
argued that no investor would like to take any risk to have an expected NPV (Net Present Value) of 0
at the end of the lifetime with a discount rate of 0. Nevertheless, there are potential business models
for large homeowners such as general contractors or municipalities who could substitute part of the
roof and façade cladding with BIPV thus avoiding the cost of an alternative material. Furthermore,
this price tag is extremely interesting as price of sale from LEC. It in fact presents the advantage of
expected lifetime economic balance in positive ground for each household.
A good business opportunity is finally offered by the n = 100%. This price, while suggesting a
real IRR around 3% for the LEP, offers the occupants the opportunity to largely increase their share of
renewable energy use without having to pay any upfront cost. In this case, the households have no
economic benefit in installing the PV, but they have no risk or upfront investment and could receive
information about their own self-sufficiency by the provider, e.g., with a monthly email.
4. Discussion
4.1. Social and Cultural Differences among Households Have a Huge Impact on Self-Sufficiency
In the local grid, if the renewable energy is not enough to cover the electric demand during a
specific hour, the aggregated self-sufficiency is assigned to each household regardless of its demand
(see Equations (1) and (2)). A large difference in terms of self-sufficiency has been observed within
the 48 households, with the individual self-sufficiencies spanning from ca. 14% to more than 28%
(see Figure 7a). Considering the absence of active strategies to increase the self-sufficiency in the cluster,
such large differences can be attributed only to socio-cultural factors and spontaneous lifestyle choices.
In Figure 7b, it appears that the most self-sufficient household has on average the peak of energy
consumption at noon (possibly due to home cooking), while the least self-sufficient one has usually
its peak consumption at 20:00. Differences are visible also over the different months of the year but
their effect is not as clear as in the hours of the day. The large differences observed in self-sufficiency,
having no active engagement or use of demand-shifting technologies, invites a deeper analysis and
understanding of the existing electric demand and the factors which affect self-sufficiency.

Buildings 2020, 10, 138

4.2. High Cumulative Energy Demand Is More Effective Than High Self-Sufficiency in Exploiting the Shared
Renewable Resource
Despite the large variation in self-sufficiency, it has been observed that the sheer amount of
energy used from the system is mainly determined by the annual cumulative demand (see Figure 9).
This phenomenon, albeit counterintuitive, is due to the fact that the variability of cumulative demand far
outweighs the variability in self-sufficiency (the largest being five or even seven times the smallest one).
In other words, the fraction self-consumed is not significant when applied to a group of households
whose entire demand is hardly significant compared to others. This fact is problematic because the
energy savings (i.e., the main earning mechanism of the investment in some market designs) come from
the amount of PV energy consumed and not from the self-sufficiency reached. The relation between
annual cumulative consumption and cumulative energy from PV is transposed in the relation between
energy consumption and lifetime balance (see Figure 11). The balance in a LEC gratis arrangement
(Figure 11a) is almost completely determined by the cumulative consumption, with the self-sufficiency
being reduced to a noise in the linear relation. Moreover, if the households are divided into three
groups according to their cumulative consumption, the biggest consumers all have positive balance
and the smallest consumers all have a negative one. This aspect suggests that, if the communal PV
system is installed under a LEC gratis arrangement, the shareholders might increase their electric
demand in a bid to outdo each other’s energy consumption. This behaviour would possibly defeat the
purpose of installing on-site renewables in the first place. It should also be considered that, due to
privacy laws and standard practice, each individual household is likely only aware of its own electric
demand and self-sufficiency. This lack of data might drive each household to work on improving
self-sufficiency instead of annual cumulative demand. It should also be remembered that the earnings
are savings, thus increasing the cumulative demand would lead to an increase in the energy bill. In this
sense, the increased exploitation of the common electricity through increased cumulative demand
would happen only if increased consumption is perceived as a value, for example through the purchase
or increased use of energy hungry appliances for cooking or DIY (Do It Yourself) purposes. How easy
or difficult it is to change self-sufficiency compared to cumulative demand should also be considered to
assess the likelihood of one scenario over the other. For example, cumulative demand might be strongly
constrained by working schedule or number of household members. These aspects reiterate the need
for a deeper study on the aspect of demand that influence self-sufficiency. From the perspective of
the investment in PV, both the changes in behaviour envisioned would increase self-consumption,
hence earning potential.
4.3. Different Selling Prices Generates Various Business Opportunities
Assuming that the shared PV system is owned by a single entity in a LEP (Local Energy Provider)
arrangement, this entity enjoys freedom in setting the price for the sale of electricity. This freedom is
nevertheless constrained by the LCOE of the PV system and by the price offered by the parent grid.
If the LEP sells electricity at a higher price than the parent-grid it will have no purchaser among the
households. This happens because the grid has the capacity to satisfy 100% of the demand of the
whole district at any time. For this reason, a coefficient “n” has been devised so that: n = 0 is the LCOE
of the local system and n = 100 is the sale of energy at the exact same price as from the parent grid.
It has been shown that at n = 0, despite selling at production cost, the lifetime balance is < 0. This is
due to the self-consumption being below 100% (i.e., ca 85%), hence ca. 15% of the energy produced
being sold at spot price (i.e., 0.3–0.15 SEK/kWh or 3–1.5 € cent/kWh). This loss also explains why in the
LEC LCOE arrangement some households still have a negative lifetime balance, as demonstrated in
Figure 11b. Another interesting selling price is the one obtained with n = 9.43% because this is the price
at which no profit or loss is made from the LEP. This price tag, albeit unattractive as an investment for a
third-party PV owner, presents an interesting way for building owners to substitute other claddings on
their properties. Using this selling price offers in fact a building material that, contrary to every other,
does not cost anything over its lifetime. If applied as common price in a LEC it allows all households

Buildings 2020, 10, 138

18 of 21

to have a positive lifetime economic balance, yet to have individual differences in earnings. It should
be said that this price was determined at the end of a previous run when the overall self-consumption
was already known. In a real case, to obtain such an equilibrium, the price should be updated at any
point in time according to the evolution of self-consumption and energy prices. Selling energy at the
price of the parent grid (n = 100) could be an interesting investment as it guarantees the LEP with a
real IRR of around 3%; it provides no economic benefits for the household consumers, but it gives
them the ability to boost their reliance on renewable without any upfront cost or risk. Furthermore,
the possibility for the households to buy voluntarily sized shares of the LEP could kick start a set of
tantalising business opportunities.
5. Conclusions
In the study, a newly developed agent-based model was tested on a shared PV system serving a
small district comprising 48 apartments in a local community. Different ownership structures were
explored. The LEC arrangement was studied both with the electricity given for free to all the equal
shareholders or given at a price (in the study the LCOE). For the LEP, because the free offering would
make no sense, an array of different prices was tried (see Table 2).
5.1. Key Findings
The main findings of the study are reported as follows and interpreted in the corresponding
paragraphs in the discussion Section 4:
•

•

•

Social and cultural differences among households have a huge impact on self-sufficiency:
The households were simulated without introducing any demand-response measure or smart
control. However, some households achieved a self-sufficiency of almost 30% using the common
PV system while others stopped short of 15%.
High cumulative energy demand is more effective than high self-sufficiency in exploiting the
shared renewable resource: Despite the large differences observed in self-sufficiency among
households, the quantity of energy received from the shared system has been determined almost
completely by the annual cumulative demand rather than by self-sufficiency.
Different selling prices generates various business opportunities: Different value of n%,
as defined in Section 2.2, generate advantage and interesting features for diverse stakeholders.
For instance, a very low n% (i.e., <10%) generates a strong drive for the shareholders to self-consume
as much PV energy as possible, but it contains a risk for the least consuming ones. Higher n%
(i.e., from ca. 10% to 100%) are interesting for building owners and BIPV solutions and, amid
increasing n%, become more and more interesting for third party energy providers.

5.2. Follow-Up Studies
The present study shows a plain set-up and a narrow set of possibilities, but it sets the stage for a
broader class of studies. In principle, some of the simplifying assumptions employed in this study
should be removed in favour of a higher realism and a more complex modelling; nevertheless, models
that are too complex for the level of uncertainty and for the input data available should be avoided.
For instance, it is tempting to change the present model for the prices from the parent grid (i.e.,
static seasonal price and long-term linear trends for sold and bought electricity) into a spot-price with
distribution costs. However, while the change reflects reality better, the long-term modelling of the
spot-price would be a daunting task and affected by huge uncertainty. Thus, it might pay off to just
maintain a simplified model for the prices (i.e., two seasonal prices for purchase and sale and time
of day variation), but to perform a stochastic simulation with variability in the time-evolution of the
prices. In other words, any further complexity addition should only be determined by the use case of
the model. Furthermore, for this model, the use case is the market design to finance and maintain a
fair and remunerative local electric energy system.

Buildings 2020, 10, 138

On the other end, there are several low hanging fruits that can be easily harvested: for example,
while in this study the price was always set by a unique actor (be it a community or a provider), it would
be interesting to explore the effect of different prosumer setting each an arbitrary price and explore their
interaction. In this sense, one more step could be to endow the agents with some level of intelligence
and let them adjust the price reacting to the environment to maximise potential economic gains.
In the present study, there are devices and loads that have not been investigated, such as EVs and
electric storages, in the local grid. These features, given a simplified enough model, are extremely easy
to be implemented and can constitute a game-changer in the effectiveness of a business model.
Another interesting and potentially prolific research direction would be the study of the demand
itself. Given the large variation of self-sufficiency found among the different agents participating in
the microgrid, it is possible to find correlation with socioeconomic and lifestyle parameters such as
median age, work–home schedules, number of members in an household, etc. This does not constitute
information in itself, but it can lead to different results according to the different shared renewable
systems. In other words, each social mix might demand a different system (capacity of PV capacity of
electric storage).
Regarding the demand, it is of paramount importance to consider how often a house remains
vacant due to change or death of the owner. These aspects should be investigated in terms of impact
over each business model, but also in terms of risk-mitigating effect of larger local grids. It shall not be
forgotten that lower risk can allow lower IRR for the investment, thus unlock wider market niches.
The vacancy of the households is also affected by socioeconomic parameters and median age of the
households; these aspects likely present spatial variability in different parts of the city and the world.
