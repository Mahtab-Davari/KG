Abstract: Emissions can be reduced by increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and supply
systems or increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy system. Denmark has a long
tradition for district heating and today it supplies more than 65 of dwellings, which indicates that
a major part of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables can be achieved at the supply system
level rather than on the individual building level. This paper presents calculations performed on a
generic Danish district undergoing major renovation. The generic district is based on an existing
district in Aalborg and consists of 1019 dwellings spread over three different building typologies.
The purpose of the investigation was to determine which combination of energy saving measures
would achieve the optimal level of energy efficiency. Calculations were made with average data for
district heating in Denmark, district heating based on natural gas, and district heating from renewable
energy sources, such as solar heating, biofuels, and heat pumps, respectively. The calculations include
costs for investment, maintenance, and operating as a function of the primary energy needs. Global
warming potential (GWP) was calculated and included CO2 emissions from space heating, domestic
hot water, and electricity for operation and household. The calculations show that for the generic
Danish district, which is already connected to a district heating network, the optimal solution is to
add 200 mm insulation to roofs (in total 300 mm) and 150 mm insulation to walls (in total 200 mm)
and replacing the existing windows with new three-layer low energy windows. Furthermore, the
calculations show that in a future scenario with a significantly higher level of renewable energy in the
energy system, a shift to individual heat pumps can reduce total emissions by up to 1.5 kg CO2 eq/m2
per year (20 reduction) at an additional cost of EUR 8.0/m2 per year (40 increase). The calculations
described in this paper are part of a larger investigation carried out in IEA EBC Annex 75.

1. Introduction
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report identified that
the sector with the main economic mitigation potentials using technologies and practices
expected to be available in 2030 (estimated from bottom-up studies) was the building sector [1].
Buildings account for approximately 40 of all energy use in Europe [2] and 30 of greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions are related to the building sector [3]; therefore, reducing building energy
use is key in mitigating climate change. In this context, European Union (EU) adopted the
so-called “2020 Climate and Energy Package” [4] in 2007 and the roadmap was updated in
October 2014 with the definition of the “2030 Climate & Energy Framework” [5].
In 2011, the Danish government published a strategy with an aim for Denmark to be
fossil-free by 2050 [6]. In 2019, the present government set a new and ambitious intermediate target for national CO2 emissions; by 2030, Denmark needs to reduce emissions by 70 in
relation to a 1990 baseline [7]. Preliminary calculations for the Danish building stock show

that to reach the overarching goal of a fossil-free society in 2050 it is necessary to reduce the
energy use of the existing building stock by up to 50 on average [8].
However, achieving significant reductions in energy use and associated emissions in a
cost-effective way is challenging for the existing building stock, especially due to the many
architectural and technical hurdles and restrictions. One of the major challenges lies in
balancing energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.
Comprehensive research has already been conducted on energy efficiency of existing
buildings and balancing energy efficiency with renewable energy production. However,
most research has focused on single buildings as in [9], where generic calculations were
carried out to investigate the balance, synergies, and trade-offs between renewable energy
measures on the one hand, and energy efficiency measures on the other hand. Results of
their investigation show that in many cases, the cost-optimal renovation package for energy
efficiency measures on the building envelope is the same regardless of the type of energy
carrier being used.
Due to the increasing complexity of the energy infrastructure regarding generation,
distribution, and use, the single building perspective can lead to sub-optimization. This
is demonstrated in, e.g., [10], where authors argue that buildings need to be considered
as active participants in a complex and wider district-level energy landscape. To achieve
this, the authors suggest the need for a new generation of energy control systems capable
of adapting to near real-time environmental conditions, while maximizing the use of
renewables and minimizing energy demand within a district environment.
Another example is [11], where the aim of the research was to investigate technoeconomic effects and environmental impacts of the energy renovation of residential building
clusters on a district heating system. A stock of 343 multi-story apartment buildings located
in two Swedish municipalities was included and studied by different cluster combinations
of slab and tower blocks. Their study reveals the benefit of integrating simulation and
optimization tools to investigate, with a high level of detail, the effect from building cluster
energy renovation on the surrounding district heating system.
A paper from Annex 75 [12] aimed at clarifying the cost-effectiveness of various
approaches combining energy efficiency and renewable energy sources implementation
and focusing on the optimal combination, with respect to the starting situation in a specific
city district. Another publication from the same project [13], presents an analysis and
comparison of nine district renovation case studies. The study showed that not only energy
performances and targets are meaningful for driving these interventions, but other factors
can be significant in the upscaling of interventions targeting energy improvements, such as
the reduction on CO2 emissions, the improvement of comfort conditions for inhabitants,
and the increase in the economic value of buildings.
Positive energy districts (PEDs) have recently become an important concept for urban
development. A major driver for the research on PEDs is the climate and energy policy of
the European Union and its member states. With the publication of the Set Plan Action
3.2, [14] several European initiatives have started working on the topic of PEDs with the
objective to support the development and implementation of at least 100 PEDs by 2025.
These include the IEA Annex 83 “Positive Energy Districts”, that brings together researchers
from European and non-European countries working on positive energy districts [15]. The
Annex is a research and dissemination network established for 4 years under the umbrella of
the International Energy Agency (IEA). It is open for research organizations and universities
and from all IEA member states working on PEDs. The objective of the Annex is to address
the PED multidisciplinary dimensions, facilitating the development of PEDs in different
worldwide urban contexts.
The main purpose of this paper is to achieve a better understanding of how to balance
energy efficiency and renewable energy under different circumstances in a typical Danish
district. In Denmark, a long tradition for district heating exists, which indicates that a major
part of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables can be achieved at the supply system
level. Therefore, the primary focus is on determining which level of energy efficiency is

Sustainability 2022, 14, 13605

needed on the building level, in order that the district heating system can deliver fossil fuel
free heat and domestic hot water throughout the year.
The paper presents calculations performed on a generic Danish district that is undergoing a major renovation. The generic district is based on an existing district in Aalborg
consisting of 1019 dwellings spread over three different building typologies: Single family
houses, detached houses, and multi-story apartment buildings. The calculations are part of
a larger investigation carried out in IEA EBC Annex 75, where eight different European
countries carry out a similar analysis. The purpose of this joint effort is to determine
differences, similarities, and generally achieving a better understanding of how to balance
energy efficiency and renewable energy under different circumstances.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a description of
the research methodology and calculation methods, the energy efficiency measures, and
renewable sources. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the investigated district
and input data. Section 4 carries out the results and discussion, and the conclusion and
lessons learned are provided in Section 5.
2. Methods
The following sections explain the approach used to perform calculations of the
total final energy consumption for the district under different circumstances. Overall, the
calculations follow the methodology developed in IEA EBC Annex 75 documented in [16].
The main advantage of this method is that it provides a fast and robust way of
comparing different district solution performances in relation to overall costs, primary
energy use, and CO2 emissions. With relatively few inputs, the methodology allows the
user to pinpoint the cost optimal set of renovation measures. In addition, by performing
simple parametric calculations, a sensitivity analysis can be performed to strengthen the
results further. The methodology is further described in [12].
2.1. Calculation Method and Data
The Danish energy calculations were performed using the ASCOT calculation tool [17],
i.e., a steady-state monthly calculation tool originally developed for energy and financial
optimization of the renovation of school buildings following the EN ISO 13790 [18] standard.
The tool calculates the final energy consumption for heating and domestic hot water and
electricity for operation and household appliances for the entire district, including system
losses in both buildings and distribution networks. The primary energy consumption
and related CO2 emissions are determined by multiplying the projected primary energy
by the CO2 emission factors, which are developed by the Danish Housing and Planning
Authority [19], as shown in Table 1. Moreover, the table shows projected energy costs
(consumer costs including taxes and charges).

The financial calculations in ASCOT are performed using net present value (NPV), i.e.,
determining the total gain of the investment when all costs and revenues over the lifetime
are considered. The method is explained in detail in [20]. The financial data used in the
calculations are presented in Table 2.

The discount rate is usually between 4 and 5 and here we have taken a conservative
choice of 4.0. The tax of interest income was set to 0 according to [20]. The inflation of
energy prices and maintenance costs were taken from [21] based on average values for the
period from 2010–2020 and the expected economic lifetime (calculation period) was chosen
as the standard 50 years, indicating that energy saving measures with a shorter expected
lifetime will be replaced during the period.
The real discount rate for savings is calculated by:
rrs =

4.0 (1 − 0.0) − 2.5
rn (1 − s) − ie
=
= 1.46
1 + ie
1 + 2.5

Similarly, the real discount rate for expenses is calculated by:
rre =

rn (1 − s) − im
4.0 (1 − 0.0) − 1.5
= 2.46
=
1 + im
1 + 1.5

The net present value factors for savings and expenses are calculated as:
fnpvs =

1 − (1 + rrs )−n
1 − (1 + 1.5)−50

2.2. Energy Efficiency Measures and Renewable Energy Sources
The first step of the methodology is to define a gross list of relevant energy efficiency
measures for each of the buildings in the district. These measures will typically include
building envelope components (replacing windows or adding insulation to walls, floors,
roofs), shading/lighting systems, ventilation systems, heating/cooling systems, and local
renewable energy systems. Several solutions are evaluated for each component by parametric analysis, e.g., different insulation levels for exterior walls, etc. to determine the best and
most cost-effective individual solutions. Measures are evaluated individually, i.e., determining the cost and energy saving potential of each measure by itself and determining the
simple payback time, and this comprises the gross list of measures. Finally, the individual
measures can be ranked based on the present value, i.e., highest present value should be
implemented first, etc.
Depending, of course, on the starting point, the order of measures would typically be
(1) measures on the building envelopes, (2) measures for HVAC systems, and (3) measures

Sustainability 2022, 14, 13605

5 of 16

related to renewable energy production. It is particularly important to include measures
on the building envelope before measures for HVAC systems, since increasing the energy
efficiency of the building can influence the choice of HVAC systems. Measures related to
renewable energy production are often not influenced by building envelope and HVAC
systems; therefore, these can usually be regarded as more or less independent measures.
When the total list has been compiled, measures are combined into so-called renovation packages where individual measures complement each other. The calculations are
performed step-by-step in a cumulative way by adding the measure with the shortest
payback time first, then the second, etc. This indicates that a graph of the correlation
between costs and primary energy or CO2 emissions will have a very specific and easily
interpretable course.
It should be noted that in practice there may be other factors which determine the
order of measures, e.g., national or local building code requirements, or improvements to
the buildings needed for them to function adequately, or the ability to supply an acceptable
indoor climate for residents/users. Moreover, it should be noted that future developments
in the outside energy system may influence decisions, e.g., a district heating or cooling
network may be updated to reduce system losses, which can then shift the cost-optimum
energy efficiency levels.
2.3. Combining the Community Demand, Renewable Solutions, and Outside Energy System

Sustainability 2022, 14, 13605

The district intervention should be planned in a way that it synergizes and integrates
well with the outside energy system, i.e., avoiding being an isolated energy island. By
planning it in order that the district can interact smartly with the greater energy system, it
can be a very useful and valuable part in the grander scheme, i.e., importing and exporting
energy and utilizing storage facilities optimally. This will help in reducing consumption
and production peaks of the district and thereby avoid sub-optimization of individual
system components.

Kildeparken is a built-up area from the 1970s in Eastern Aalborg that consists of three
clusters of buildings: Blåkildevej, Fyrkildevej, and Ravnkildevej. Kildeparken has a total
area of approx. 540,000 m2 and around 2450 people live there. Kildeparken consists of 155
single-family houses, 18 apartment blocks containing 432 apartments, and 432 detached
houses, and the total heated area is approx. 100,000 m2 (see Figures 2 and 3).

3.2. Building Envelopes
The building envelopes are generally worn down and there are quite significant
thermal bridges. Apartment blocks have concrete walls with approx. 50 mm insulation and
single-family houses and detached houses have brick walls with approx. 50 mm insulation.
Roofs have approx. 100 mm insulation and windows have a two-layer glazing and wooden
frame. Table 4 lists the approximate mean U-values before renovation. The U-values reflect

the typical constructions of the time; however, compared to Danish standards of today
U-values are quite high.

3.3. Building Systems
The buildings all have combinations of mechanical exhaust ventilation and natural
ventilation. Air is extracted from kitchens (through the cooker hood) and bathrooms and
supplied by natural ventilation/infiltration through open windows/doors and leaks in the
building envelope.
The district is supplied with heat from the outside through an existing district heating
network. Electricity is supplied via the common electricity grid in Denmark.
3.4. Renovation Measures and Local Renewable Energy Sources
The renovation measures that can be implemented to increase the overall energy efficiency of the district cover replacing the existing windows, adding insulation to the roof,
adding insulation to the exterior walls, installing individual heat pumps, installing solar
thermal panels, installing photovoltaic panels, and installing balanced mechanical ventilation
with heat recovery. Table 5 shows the list and data for individual measures (M1–M7) and
Table 6 shows the list of renovation packages (M8–M11 and A0–A5). Scenarios M8–M11 are
all based on the existing district heating system, and in scenarios A0–A5, district heating is
replaced by individual heat pumps and complemented by a solar thermal installation for
domestic hot water production. Scenario A0 corresponds to the reference case where the only
change is that heating is now based on individual heat pumps. In the tables, BR61 represents
the building regulations from 1961 [25] which were in effect when Kildeparken was built and
corresponds to the reference scenario. “HP” is heat pump, “SH” is solar thermal, “PV” is
photovoltaics, and “MVHR” is mechanical ventilation with heat recovery.
3.5. Global Renewable Energy Sources
In the initial scenario, corresponding to the year 2025, the data from Table 1 are used
in the calculations. However, to further investigate the effect of increasing the overall
coverage of renewable energy sources in the outside energy system, two further scenarios
are evaluated.
In the first scenario, it is assumed that approx. 50 of the Danish energy supply is based
on renewable energy sources. For heat, 10 is covered by solar thermal installations and 40
is covered by heat pumps and these renewable energy sources are connected to the district
heating network. For electricity, 10 is supplied by PV installations and 40 is supplied by
wind turbines. The relevant financial data for this scenario are given in Table 7.
To investigate the possibilities and economic circumstances related to introducing even
higher levels of renewable energy in the global energy system, a scenario is investigated where
the data for solar heating and photovoltaics are the same as shown in Table 7, but the heat
pump supply is increased to supply 90 of heat and wind turbines are increased to supply 90
of electricity, i.e., corresponding to a situation with 100 renewable energy production.

4. Results and Discussion
The result for each calculation covers the total final consumption, the primary energy
use, the operational costs, the emissions (GWP), and the life cycle costs (NPV). As an
example, Table 8 shows the calculation results for the reference case and the M1 scenario,
i.e., replacing the windows with three-layer low energy windows.

In the following sections the results of four different analysis are presented.
4.1. Increasing Renewable Energy in the Energy Mix
The purpose of the first analyses is to determine how an increased share of renewable
energy in the energy mix will influence the cost-optimality of renovation measures, i.e.,
how will the decarbonization of energy systems influence the balance between energy
efficiency and renewable energy. The calculation compares the situation corresponding
to the existing energy mix of today and the expected future energy mix as described in
Table 7. Results are plotted in Figure 4 where M0 and A0 are the reference scenarios,
M1 and A1 correspond to replacing the windows, M8 and A2 correspond to adding PV,
M10, and A3 to insulating roofs, M9 and A4 to insulating walls, and finally M11 and A5 to
installing mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. The order of the measures corresponds
to starting with the lowest simple payback time and gives the curves their distinct look
with an easily interpretable minimum that signifies the cost-optimal solution. DH (DK) is
the present energy mix in Denmark and DH (RE) is an energy mix corresponding to the
scenario described in Table 7, i.e., where 50 of energy is based on renewable sources. The
results are shown in Figure 4 as the primary energy use as a function of the total costs per
year (left) and the emissions as a function of the total costs per year (right).
Comparing the two scenarios both primary energy use and emissions will decrease
significantly when the share of renewable energy in the energy mix is increased, and this
affects the cost-optimality. With the present energy mix the final renovation stage (installing
mechanical ventilation with heat recovery) has lower total costs per year than the reference

4.3. District Heating vs. Individual Heat Pumps
The purpose of the third analyses is to determine whether it makes sense to consider
switching the existing district heating system for individual heat pumps. The rationale
behind this thought is that a shift to individual heating will remove the system losses in the
district heating network (corresponding to approx. 20 in Denmark). For this purpose, two
scenarios are developed: DH (RE) and IH (RE) correspond to future scenarios where the
energy system has an increased level of renewable sources (as described in Table 7). DH
corresponds to maintaining the existing district heating network and IH corresponds to a
switch to individual heat pumps. The results are shown in Figure 6.

Comparing the two scenarios in Figure 5, it is clearly still cost‐effective to introduce
energy‐saving measures in a district that does not meet modern energy‐efficiency require‐
ments. However, it should be noted that if the starting point (the reference building) is
shifted even further toward today’s standards, the system losses (heat loss in the district
heating network and electricity network) will make investments in energy efficiency less
and less cost‐effective.
4.3. District Heating vs. Individual Heat Pumps
The purpose of the third analyses is to determine whether it makes sense to consider
switching the existing district heating system for individual heat pumps. The rationale
behind this thought is that a shift to individual heating will remove the system losses in
the district heating network (corresponding to approx. 20% in Denmark). For this pur‐
pose, two scenarios are developed: DH (RE) and IH (RE) correspond to future scenarios
where the energy system has an increased level of renewable sources (as described in Ta‐
ble 7). DH corresponds to maintaining the existing district heating network and IH corre‐
sponds to a switch to individual heat pumps. The results are shown in Figure 6.

In other countries, which may not have existing district heating networks, it may be more
advisable to look at individual solutions. However, it is important to note that using central
solutions (e.g., district heating) rather than decentral solutions (e.g., individual heat pumps)

Sustainability 2022, 14, 13605

has the added benefit of enabling incorporation of, e.g., waste heat in the network, common
storage facilities, and similar synergies, all of which are very important factors to consider
when designing future energy systems.
Finally, the calculations show that the balance between energy efficiency measures and
renewable energy sources is very dependent on the starting situation. If the district has a
relatively high level of energy efficiency (buildings erected in the last three decades) to start
with, further investments should probably focus on renewable energy rather than energy
efficiency. However, this should always be based on an individual case-by-case assessment.
Generally, investigations in this paper were performed prior to the war in Ukraine,
which indicates that prices of energy saving measures and energy are even more volatile
today than what they were when the calculations were performed. This, of course, adds
further to the uncertainty of the results, but as shown in Section 4.4, even relatively large
variations in prices do not necessarily significantly alter the conclusions.
Finally, it should be noted that renovation not only improves energy efficiency of buildings,
but has a large amount of co-benefits as well, e.g., improvement of indoor climate, lower
influence of price increases and thereby risks of increased energy-poverty, etc. These co-benefits
are difficult to weigh against emissions and costs, but can sometimes be more important.
The calculations described in this paper relate to a very homogenous district that
comprises only single- and multi-family dwellings and has single sources for heat and
electricity. Therefore, future research should focus on determining relevant solutions in
more heterogenous districts involving, e.g., industry and commercial buildings, etc. and
districts where the existing energy infrastructure is less developed or incoherent.
